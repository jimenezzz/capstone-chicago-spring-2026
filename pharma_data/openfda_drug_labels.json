        "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics: Serum, urine and tear concentrations of ofloxacin were measured in 30 healthy women at various time points during a ten-day course of treatment with ofloxacin ophthalmic solution. The mean serum ofloxacin concentration ranged from 0.4 ng/mL to 1.9 ng/mL. Maximum ofloxacin concentration increased from 1.1 ng/mL on day one to 1.9 ng/mL on day 11 after QID dosing for 10 1/2 days. Maximum serum ofloxacin concentrations after ten days of topical ophthalmic dosing were more than 1000 times lower than those reported after standard oral doses of ofloxacin. Tear ofloxacin concentrations ranged from 5.7 to 31 mcg/g during the 40 minute period following the last dose on day 11. Mean tear concentration measured four hours after topical ophthalmic dosing was 9.2 mcg/g. Corneal tissue concentrations of 4.4 mcg/mL were observed four hours after beginning topical ocular application of two drops of ofloxacin ophthalmic solution every 30 minutes. Ofloxacin was excreted in the urine primarily unmodified. Microbiology: Ofloxacin has in vitro activity against a broad range of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Ofloxacin is bactericidal at concentrations equal to or slightly greater than inhibitory concentrations. Ofloxacin is thought to exert a bactericidal effect on susceptible bacterial cells by inhibiting DNA gyrase, an essential bacterial enzyme which is a critical catalyst in the duplication, transcription, and repair of bacterial DNA. Cross-resistance has been observed between ofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones. There is generally no cross-resistance between ofloxacin and other classes of antibacterial agents such as beta-lactams or aminoglycosides. Ofloxacin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following organisms both in vitro and clinically, in conjunctival and/or corneal ulcer infections (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ). *Efficacy for this organism was studied in fewer than 10 infections AEROBES, GRAM-POSITIVE: AEROBES, GRAM-NEGATIVE: ANAEROBIC SPECIES: Staphylococcus aureus Enterobacter cloacae Propionibacterium acnes Staphylococcus epidermidis Haemophilus influenzae Streptococcus pneumoniae Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Serratia marcescens* The safety and effectiveness of ofloxacin ophthalmic solution in treating ophthalmologic infections due to the following organisms have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Ofloxacin ophthalmic solution has been shown to be active in vitro against most strains of these organisms but the clinical significance in ophthalmologic infections is unknown. AEROBES, GRAM-POSITIVE: AEROBES, GRAM-NEGATIVE: OTHER: Enterococcus faecalis Acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. anitratus Chlamydia trachomatis Listeria monocytogenes Acinetobacter calcoaceticus var.

Clinical outcomes for the trial demonstrated a clinical improvement rate of 86% (54/63) for the ofloxacin treated group versus 72% (48/67) for the placebo treated group after 2 days of therapy. Microbiological outcomes for the same clinical trial demonstrated an eradication rate for causative pathogens of 65% (41/63) for the ofloxacin treated group versus 25% (17/67) for the vehicle treated group after 2 days of therapy. Please note that microbiologic eradication does not always correlate with clinical outcome in anti-infective trials. Corneal ulcers: In a randomized, double-masked, multi-center clinical trial of 140 subjects with positive cultures, ofloxacin ophthalmic solution treated subjects had an overall clinical success rate (complete re-epithelialization and no progression of the infiltrate for two consecutive visits) of 82% (61/74) compared to 80% (53/66) for the fortified antibiotic group, consisting of 1.5% tobramycin and 10% cefazolin solutions. The median time to clinical success was 11 days for the ofloxacin treated group and 10 days for the fortified treatment group."

        "Microbiology: Ofloxacin has in vitro activity against a broad range of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Ofloxacin is bactericidal at concentrations equal to or slightly greater than inhibitory concentrations. Ofloxacin is thought to exert a bactericidal effect on susceptible bacterial cells by inhibiting DNA gyrase, an essential bacterial enzyme which is a critical catalyst in the duplication, transcription, and repair of bacterial DNA. Cross-resistance has been observed between ofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones. There is generally no cross-resistance between ofloxacin and other classes of antibacterial agents such as beta-lactams or aminoglycosides. Ofloxacin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following organisms both in vitro and clinically, in conjunctival and/or corneal ulcer infections (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ). *Efficacy for this organism was studied in fewer than 10 infections AEROBES, GRAM-POSITIVE: AEROBES, GRAM-NEGATIVE: ANAEROBIC SPECIES: Staphylococcus aureus Enterobacter cloacae Propionibacterium acnes Staphylococcus epidermidis Haemophilus influenzae Streptococcus pneumoniae Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Serratia marcescens* The safety and effectiveness of ofloxacin ophthalmic solution in treating ophthalmologic infections due to the following organisms have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

      ],
      "warnings": [
        "WARNINGS NOT FOR INJECTION. Ofloxacin ophthalmic solution should not be injected subconjunctivally, nor should it be introduced directly into the anterior chamber of the eye. There are rare reports of anaphylactic reaction/shock and fatal hypersensitivity reactions in patients receiving systemic quinolones, some following the first dose, including ofloxacin. Some reactions were accompanied by cardiovascular collapse, loss of consciousness, angioedema (including laryngeal, pharyngeal or facial edema), airway obstruction, dyspnea, urticaria, and itching. A rare occurrence of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, which progressed to toxic epidermal necrolysis, has been reported in a patient who was receiving topical ophthalmic ofloxacin. If an allergic reaction to ofloxacin occurs, discontinue the drug. Serious acute hypersensitivity reactions may require immediate emergency treatment. Oxygen and airway management, including intubation should be administered as clinically indicated."
      ],
      "precautions": [
        "PRECAUTIONS General: As with other anti-infectives, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs discontinue use and institute alternative therapy. Whenever clinical judgment dictates, the patient should be examined with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. Ofloxacin should be discontinued at the first appearance of a skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity reaction. The systemic administration of quinolones, including ofloxacin, has led to lesions or erosions of the cartilage in weight-bearing joints and other signs of arthropathy in immature animals of various species. Ofloxacin, administered systemically at 10 mg/kg/day in young dogs (equivalent to 110 times the maximum recommended daily adult ophthalmic dose) has been associated with these types of effects. Information for Patients: Avoid contaminating the applicator tip with material from the eye, fingers or other source. Systemic quinolones, including ofloxacin, have been associated with hypersensitivity reactions, even following a single dose. Discontinue use immediately and contact your physician at the first sign of a rash or allergic reaction. Drug Interactions: Specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with ofloxacin ophthalmic solution. However, the systemic administration of some quinolones has been shown to elevate plasma concentrations of theophylline, interfere with the metabolism of caffeine, and enhance the effects of the oral anticoagulant warfarin and its derivatives, and has been associated with transient elevations in serum creatinine in patients receiving cyclosporine concomitantly. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Long term studies to determine the carcinogenic potential of ofloxacin have not been conducted. Ofloxacin was not mutagenic in the Ames test, in vitro and in vivo cytogenic assay, sister chromatid exchange assay (Chinese hamster and human cell lines), unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay using human fibroblasts, the dominant lethal assay, or mouse micronucleus assay. Ofloxacin was positive in the UDS test using rat hepatocyte, and in the mouse lymphoma assay. In fertility studies in rats, ofloxacin did not affect male or female fertility or morphological or reproductive performance at oral dosing up to 360 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 4000 times the maximum recommended daily ophthalmic dose). Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: Ofloxacin has been shown to have an embryocidal effect in rats and in rabbits when given in doses of 810 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 9000 times the maximum recommended daily ophthalmic dose) and 160 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 1800 times the maximum recommended daily ophthalmic dose). These dosages resulted in decreased fetal body weight and increased fetal mortality in rats and rabbits, respectively. Minor fetal skeletal variations were reported in rats receiving doses of 810 mg/kg/day. Ofloxacin has not been shown to be teratogenic at doses as high as 810 mg/kg/day and 160 mg/kg/day when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits, respectively. Nonteratogenic Effects: Additional studies in rats with doses up to 360 mg/kg/day during late gestation showed no adverse effect on late fetal development, labor, delivery, lactation, neonatal viability, or growth of the newborn. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ofloxacin ophthalmic solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers: In nursing women a single 200 mg oral dose resulted in concentrations of ofloxacin in milk which were similar to those found in plasma. It is not known whether ofloxacin is excreted in human milk following topical ophthalmic administration. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from ofloxacin in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in infants below the age of one year have not been established. Quinolones, including ofloxacin, have been shown to cause arthropathy in immature animals after oral administration; however, topical ocular administration of ofloxacin to immature animals has not shown any arthropathy. There is no evidence that the ophthalmic dosage form of ofloxacin has any effect on weight bearing joints. Geriatric use: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients."

        "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Use the lowest effective dosage for shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. ( 2.1 ) Rheumatoid Arthritis, Osteoarthritis, and Ankylosing Spondylitis Naproxen tablets 250 mg (one-half tablet) 500 mg twice daily Naproxen sodium tablets 275 mg (one-half tablet) 550 mg twice daily The dose may be adjusted up or down depending on the clinical response of the patient. In patients who tolerate lower doses well, the dose may be increased to naproxen 1500 mg/ day for up to 6 months. Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Naproxen tablets may not allow for the flexible dose titration needed in pediatric patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. A liquid formulation may be more appropriate. Recommended total daily dose of naproxen is approximately 10 mg/kg given in 2 divided doses. Dosing with naproxen tablets is not appropriate for children weighing less than 50 kilograms. Management of Pain, Primary Dysmenorrhea, and Acute Tendonitis and Bursitis Recommended starting dose 550 mg of naproxen sodium as naproxen sodium tablets followed by 550 mg every 12 hours or 275 mg every 6 to 8 hours as required. The initial total daily dose should not exceed 1375 mg of naproxen sodium. Thereafter, the total daily dose should not exceed 1100 mg of naproxen sodium. Naproxen sodium tablets are recommended for the management of acute painful conditions when prompt onset of pain relief is desired. Acute Gout Recommended starting dose 750 mg of naproxen tablets followed by 250 mg every 8 hours until the attack has subsided. Naproxen sodium tablets may also be used at a starting dose of 825 mg followed by 275 mg every 8 hours. 2.1 General Dosing Instructions Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ) ]. After observing the response to initial therapy with naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient\u2019s needs. Naproxen-containing products such as naproxen and naproxen sodium tablets, and other naproxen products should not be used concomitantly since they all circulate in the plasma as the naproxen anion. 2.2 Rheumatoid Arthritis, Osteoarthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis The recommended dosages of naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Recommended dosages for naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets Naproxen tablets 250 mg (one half tablet) 500 mg twice daily Naproxen sodium tablets 275 mg (one half tablet) 550 mg (naproxen 500 mg with 50 mg sodium) twice daily During long-term administration, the dose of naproxen may be adjusted up or down depending on the clinical response of the patient. A lower daily dose may suffice for long-term administration. The morning and evening doses do not have to be equal in size and administration of the drug more frequently than twice daily does not generally make a difference in response. In patients who tolerate lower doses well, the dose may be increased to naproxen 1500 mg/day for limited periods of up to 6 months when a higher level of anti-inflammatory/analgesic activity is required. When treating such patients with naproxen 1500 mg/day, the physician should observe sufficient increased clinical benefits to offset the potential increased risk. 2.3 Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Naproxen solid-oral dosage forms may not allow for the flexible dose titration needed in pediatric patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. A liquid formulation may be more appropriate for weight-based dosing and due to the need for dose flexibility in children. In pediatric patients, doses of 5 mg/kg/day produced plasma levels of naproxen similar to those seen in adults taking 500 mg of naproxen [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 ) ]. The recommended total daily dose of naproxen is approximately 10 mg/kg given in 2 divided doses. Dosing with naproxen tablets is not appropriate for children weighing less than 50 kilograms. 2.4 Management of Pain, Primary Dysmenorrhea, and Acute Tendonitis and Bursitis The recommended starting dose of naproxen sodium tablets is 550 mg followed by 550 mg every 12 hours or 275 mg (one half of a 550 mg tablet) every 6 to 8 hours as required. The initial total daily dose should not exceed 1375 mg (two and one-half tablets) of naproxen sodium. Thereafter, the total daily dose should not exceed 1100 mg of naproxen sodium. Because the sodium salt of naproxen is more rapidly absorbed, naproxen sodium tablets is recommended for the management of acute painful conditions when prompt onset of pain relief is desired. Naproxen tablets may also be used. The recommended starting dose of naproxen tablets is 500 mg followed by 250 mg (one half of a 500 mg naproxen tablet) every 6 to 8 hours as required. The total daily dose should not exceed 1250 mg of naproxen. 2.5 Acute Gout The recommended starting dose is 750 mg (one and one-half tablets) of naproxen tablets followed by 250 mg (one-half tablet) every 8 hours until the attack has subsided. Naproxen sodium tablets may also be used at a starting dose of 825 mg (one and one-half tablets) followed by 275 mg (one-half tablet) every 8 hours. 2.6 Non-Interchangeability with Other Formulations of Naproxen Different dose strengths and formulations (e.g., tablets, suspension) of naproxen are not interchangeable. This difference should be taken into consideration when changing strengths or formulations."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hepatotoxicity : Inform patients of warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity. Discontinue if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen or if clinical signs and symptoms of liver disease develop. ( 5.3 ) Hypertension : Patients taking some antihypertensive medications may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. Monitor blood pressure. ( 5.4 , 7 ) Heart Failure and Edema: Avoid use of naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets in patients with severe heart failure unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening heart failure. ( 5.5 ) Renal Toxicity : Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia. Avoid use of naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets in patients with advanced renal disease unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening renal function. ( 5.6 ) Anaphylactic Reactions: Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. ( 5.7 ) Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity: Naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets are contraindicated in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma. Monitor patients with preexisting asthma (without aspirin sensitivity). ( 5.8 ) Serious Skin Reactions : Discontinue naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets at first appearance of skin rash or other signs of hypersensitivity. ( 5.9 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS): Discontinue and evaluate clinically ( 5.10 ). Fetal Toxicity: Limit use of NSAIDs, including naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets, between about 20 to 30 weeks in pregnancy due to the risk of oligohydramnios/fetal dysfunction. Avoid use of NSAIDs in women at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy due to the risks of oligohydramnios/fetal renal dysfunction and premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. ( 5.11 , 8.1 ) Hematologic Toxicity : Monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit in patients with any signs or symptoms of anemia. ( 5.12 , 7 ) 5.1 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as naproxen, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ]. Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. Post-MI Patients Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up. Avoid the use of naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets are used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia. 5.2 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation NSAIDs, including naproxen, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk. Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding. Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients: \u2022 Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration. \u2022 Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time. \u2022 Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs. \u2022 Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy. \u2022 If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. \u2022 In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity Elevations of ALT or AST (three or more times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) have been reported in approximately 1% of NSAID-treated patients in clinical trials. In addition, rare, sometimes fatal, cases of severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported. Elevations of ALT or AST (less than three times ULN) may occur in up to 15% of patients treated with NSAIDs including naproxen. Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and \u201cflu-like\u201d symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient. 5.4 Hypertension NSAIDs, including naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets, can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ]. Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy. 5.5 Heart Failure and Edema The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists\u2019 Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death. Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of naproxen may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ]. Avoid the use of naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure. Since each naproxen sodium tablet contains 50 mg of sodium (about 2 mEq per each 500 mg of naproxen), this should be considered in patients whose overall intake of sodium must be severely restricted. 5.6 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia Renal Toxicity Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state. No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with preexisting renal disease. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ]. Avoid the use of naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. Hyperkalemia Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state. 5.7 Anaphylactic Reactions Naproxen has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to naproxen and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) ]. Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.8 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets are contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. When naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets is used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma. 5.9 Serious Skin Reactions NSAIDs, including naproxen, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. NSAIDs can also cause fixed drug eruption (FDE). FDE may present as a more severe variant known as generalized bullous fixed drug eruption (GBFDE), which can be life-threatening. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets are contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 5.10 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported in patients taking NSAIDs such as naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling. Other clinical manifestations may include hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis. Sometimes symptoms of DRESS may resemble an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its presentation, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, discontinue naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets and evaluate the patient immediately. 5.11 Fetal Toxicity Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus Avoid use of NSAIDs , including naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets, in pregnant women at about 30 weeks of gestation and later. NSAIDs, including naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets, increase the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at approximately this gestational age. Oligohydramnios /Neonatal Renal Impairment Use of NSAIDs , including naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. Oligohydramnios is often, but not always, reversible with treatment discontinuation. Complications of prolonged oligohydramnios may, for example, include limb contractures and delayed lung maturation. In some postmarketing cases of impaired neonatal renal function, invasive procedures such as exchange transfusion or dialysis were required. If NSAID treatment is necessary between about 20 weeks and 30 weeks gestation, limit naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. Consider ultrasound monitoring of amniotic fluid if naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets treatment extends beyond 48 hours. Discontinue naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets if oligohydramnios occurs and follow up according to clinical practice [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. 5.12 Hematologic Toxicity Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit. NSAIDs, including naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders or concomitant use of warfarin and other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. 5.13 Masking of Inflammation and Fever The pharmacological activity of naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections. 5.14 Long-Term Use and Laboratory Monitoring Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a CBC and a chemistry profile periodically [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.6 ) ]. Patients with initial hemoglobin values of 10g or less who are to receive long-term therapy should have hemoglobin values determined periodically. Because of adverse eye findings in animal studies with drugs of this class, it is recommended that ophthalmic studies be carried out if any change or disturbance in vision occurs."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc., USA at 1 (888) 721-7115 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse reactions reported in controlled clinical trials in 960 patients treated for rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis are listed below. In general, reactions in patients treated chronically were reported 2 to 10 times more frequently than they were in short-term studies in the 962 patients treated for mild to moderate pain or for dysmenorrhea. The most frequent complaints reported related to the gastrointestinal tract. A clinical study found gastrointestinal reactions to be more frequent and more severe in rheumatoid arthritis patients taking daily doses of 1500 mg naproxen compared to those taking 750 mg naproxen. In controlled clinical trials with about 80 pediatric patients and in well-monitored, open-label studies with about 400 pediatric patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis treated with naproxen, the incidence of rash and prolonged bleeding times were greater, the incidence of gastrointestinal and central nervous system reactions were about the same, and the incidence of other reactions were lower in pediatric patients than in adults. In patients taking naproxen in clinical trials, the most frequently reported adverse experiences in approximately 1% to 10% of patients were: Gastrointestinal (GI) Experiences, including: heartburn*, abdominal pain*, nausea*, constipation*, diarrhea, dyspepsia, stomatitis Central Nervous System: headache*, dizziness*, drowsiness*, lightheadedness, vertigo Dermatologic: pruritus (itching)*, skin eruptions*, ecchymoses*, sweating, purpura Special Senses: tinnitus*, visual disturbances, hearing disturbances Cardiovascular: edema*, palpitations General: dyspnea*, thirst *Incidence of reported reaction between 3% and 9%. Those reactions occurring in less than 3% of the patients are unmarked. In patients taking NSAIDs, the following adverse experiences have also been reported in approximately 1% to 10% of patients. Gastrointestinal (GI) Experiences, including: flatulence, gross bleeding/perforation, GI ulcers (gastric/duodenal), vomiting General: abnormal renal function, anemia, elevated liver enzymes, increased bleeding time, rashes The following are additional adverse experiences reported in <1% of patients taking naproxen during clinical trials. Gastrointestinal: pancreatitis, vomiting Hepatobiliary: jaundice Hemic and Lymphatic: melena, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis Nervous System: inability to concentrate Dermatologic: skin rashes 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of naproxen. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following are additional adverse experiences reported in <1% of patients taking naproxen during clinical trials and through postmarketing reports. Those adverse reactions observed through postmarketing reports are italicized. Body as a Whole: anaphylactoid reactions, angioneurotic edema, menstrual disorders, pyrexia (chills and fever) Cardiovascular: congestive heart failure, vasculitis, hypertension, pulmonary edema Gastrointestinal: inflammation, bleeding (sometimes fatal, particularly in the elderly), ulceration, perforation and obstruction of the upper or lower gastrointestinal tract. Esophagitis, stomatitis, hematemesis, colitis, exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease). Hepatobiliary: abnormal liver function tests, hepatitis (some cases have been fatal) Hemic and Lymphatic: eosinophilia, leucopenia, granulocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia Metabolic and Nutritional: hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia Nervous System: depression, dream abnormalities, insomnia, malaise, myalgia, muscle weakness, aseptic meningitis, cognitive dysfunction, convulsions Respiratory: eosinophilic pneumonitis, asthma Dermatologic: alopecia, urticaria, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, erythema nodosum, fixed drug eruption, lichen planus, pustular reaction, systemic lupus erythematoses, bullous reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, photosensitive dermatitis, photosensitivity reactions, including rare cases resembling porphyria cutanea tarda (pseudoporphyria) or epidermolysis bullosa. If skin fragility, blistering or other symptoms suggestive of pseudoporphyria occur, treatment should be discontinued and the patient monitored. Special Senses: hearing impairment, corneal opacity, papillitis, retrobulbar optic neuritis, papilledema Urogenital: glomerular nephritis, hematuria, hyperkalemia, interstitial nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, renal disease, renal failure, renal papillary necrosis, raised serum creatinine Reproduction (female): infertility In patients taking NSAIDs, the following adverse experiences have also been reported in <1% of patients.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions with naproxen. Table 1: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with naproxen Drugs That Interfere with Hemostasis Clinical Impact: \u2022 Naproxen and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of naproxen and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone. \u2022 Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone. Intervention: Monitor patients with concomitant use of naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for signs of bleeding [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 ) ]. Aspirin Clinical Impact: A pharmacodynamic (PD) study has demonstrated an interaction in which lower dose naproxen (220mg/day or 220mg twice daily) interfered with the antiplatelet effect of low-dose immediate-release aspirin, with the interaction most marked during the washout period of naproxen ( see 12.2 Pharmacodynamics) . There is reason to expect that the interaction would be present with prescription doses of naproxen or with enteric-coated low-dose aspirin; however, the peak interference with aspirin function may be later than observed in the PD study due to the longer washout period. Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ]. Intervention: Because there may be an increased risk of cardiovascular events following discontinuation of naproxen due to the interference with the antiplatelet effect of aspirin during the washout period, for patients taking low-dose aspirin for cardioprotection who require intermittent analgesics, consider use of an NSAID that does not interfere with the antiplatelet effect of aspirin, or non-NSAID analgesics where appropriate. Concomitant use of naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 ) ]. Naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets are not substitutes for low dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection. ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, and Beta-Blockers Clinical Impact: \u2022 NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or beta-blockers (including propranolol). \u2022 In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or have renal impairment, co-administration of an NSAID with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Intervention: \u2022 During concomitant use of naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets and ACE-inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers, monitor blood pressure to ensure that the desired blood pressure is obtained. \u2022 During concomitant use of naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets and ACE-inhibitors or ARBs in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted, or have impaired renal function, monitor for signs of worsening renal function [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) ]. \u2022 When these drugs are administered concomitantly, patients should be adequately hydrated. Assess renal function at the beginning of the concomitant treatment and periodically thereafter. Diuretics Clinical Impact: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, showed that NSAIDs reduced the natriuretic effect of loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) and thiazide diuretics in some patients. This effect has been attributed to the NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets with diuretics, observe patients for signs of worsening renal function, in addition to assuring diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) ]. Digoxin Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of naproxen with digoxin has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin. Intervention: During concomitant use of naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets and digoxin, monitor serum digoxin levels. Lithium Clinical Impact: NSAIDs have produced elevations in plasma lithium levels and reductions in renal lithium clearance . The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15%, and the renal clearance decreased by approximately 20%. This effect has been attributed to NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets and lithium, monitor patients for signs of lithium toxicity. Methotrexate Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of NSAIDs and methotrexate may increase the risk for methotrexate toxicity (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction). Intervention: During concomitant use of naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets and methotrexate, monitor patients for methotrexate toxicity. Cyclosporine Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets and cyclosporine may increase cyclosporine\u2019s nephrotoxicity. Intervention: During concomitant use of naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets and cyclosporine, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. NSAIDs and Salicylates Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of naproxen with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) increases the risk of GI toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ]. Intervention: The concomitant use of naproxen with other NSAIDs or salicylates is not recommended. Pemetrexed Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets and pemetrexed may increase the risk of pemetrexed-associated myelosuppression, renal, and GI toxicity (see the pemetrexed prescribing information). Intervention: During concomitant use of naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets and pemetrexed, in patients with renal impairment whose creatinine clearance ranges from 45 to 79 mL/min, monitor for myelosuppression, renal and GI toxicity. NSAIDs with short elimination half-lives (e.g., diclofenac, indomethacin) should be avoided for a period of two days before, the day of, and two days following administration of pemetrexed. In the absence of data regarding potential interaction between pemetrexed and NSAIDs with longer half-lives (e.g., meloxicam, nabumetone), patients taking these NSAIDs should interrupt dosing for at least five days before, the day of, and two days following pemetrexed administration. Antacids and Sucralfate Clinical Impact: Concomitant administration of some antacids (magnesium oxide or aluminum hydroxide) and sucralfate can delay the absorption of naproxen. Intervention: Concomitant administration of antacids such as magnesium oxide or aluminum hydroxide, and sucralfate with naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets is not recommended. Cholestyramine Clinical Impact: Concomitant administration of cholestyramine can delay the absorption of naproxen. Intervention: Concomitant administration of cholestyramine with naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets is not recommended. Probenecid Clinical Impact: Probenecid given concurrently increases naproxen anion plasma levels and extends its plasma half-life significantly. Intervention: Patients simultaneously receiving naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets and probenecid should be observed for adjustment of dose if required. Other albumin-bound drugs Clinical Impact: Naproxen is highly bound to plasma albumin; it thus has a theoretical potential for interaction with other albumin-bound drugs such as coumarin-type anticoagulants, sulphonylureas, hydantoins, other NSAIDs, and aspirin . Intervention: Patients simultaneously receiving naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets and a hydantoin, sulphonamide or sulphonylurea should be observed for adjustment of dose if required. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Bleeding times Clinical Impact: Naproxen may decrease platelet aggregation and prolong bleeding time. Intervention: This effect should be kept in mind when bleeding times are determined. Porter-Silber test Clinical Impact: The administration of naproxen may result in increased urinary values for 17-ketogenic steroids because of an interaction between the drug and/or its metabolites with m-di-nitrobenzene used in this assay. Intervention: Although 17-hydroxy-corticosteroid measurements (Porter-Silber test) do not appear to be artifactually altered, it is suggested that therapy with naproxen be temporarily discontinued 72 hours before adrenal function tests are performed if the Porter-Silber test is to be used. Urinary assays of 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid (5HIAA) Clinical Impact: Naproxen may interfere with some urinary assays of 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid (5HIAA). Intervention: This effect should be kept in mind when urinary 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid is determined. Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (e.g. warfarin, aspirin, SSRIs/SNRIs): Monitor patients for bleeding who are concomitantly taking naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets with drugs that interfere with hemostasis. Concomitant use of naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended. ( 7 ) ACE inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARB), or Beta-Blockers: Concomitant use with naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets may diminish the antihypertensive effect of these drugs. Monitor blood pressure. ( 7 ) ACE Inhibitors and ARBs: Concomitant use with naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets in elderly, volume depleted, or those with renal impairment may result in deterioration of renal function. In such high risk patients, monitor for signs of worsening renal function. ( 7 ) Diuretics: NSAIDs can reduce natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazide diuretics. Monitor patients to assure diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects. ( 7 ) Digoxin: Concomitant use with naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets can increase serum concentration and prolong half-life of digoxin. Monitor serum digoxin levels. ( 7 )"

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Infertility : NSAIDs are associated with reversible infertility. Consider withdrawal of naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets in women who have difficulties conceiving. ( 8.3 ) Renal Impairment : Naproxen-containing products are not recommended for use in patients with moderate to severe and severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min). ( 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Use of NSAIDs, including naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. Because of these risks, limit dose and duration of naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets use between about 20 and 30 weeks of gestation, and avoid naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets use at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations, Data). Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus Use of NSAIDs, including naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets, at about 30 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy increases the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment Use of NSAIDs at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. Data from observational studies regarding other potential embryofetal risks of NSAID use in women in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. In animal reproduction studies in rats, rabbits, and mice no evidence of teratogenicity or fetal harm when naproxen was administered during the period of organogenesis at doses 0.13, 0.26, and 0.6 times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 1500 mg/day, respectively [ see Data ]. Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as naproxen, resulted in increased pre-and post-implantation loss. Prostaglandins also have been shown to have an important role in fetal kidney development. In published animal studies, prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors have been reported to impair kidney development when administered at clinically relevant doses. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Avoid use of NSAIDs in women at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy, because NSAIDs, including naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus (see Data ). Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: If an NSAID is necessary at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy, limit the use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. If naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets treatment extends beyond 48 hours, consider monitoring with ultrasound for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, discontinue naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets, and follow up according to clinical practice (see Data ). Labor or Delivery There are no studies on the effects of naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDS, including naproxen, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth. Data Human Data There is some evidence to suggest that when inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis are used to delay preterm labor, there is an increased risk of neonatal complications such as necrotizing enterocolitis, patent ductus arteriosus, and intracranial hemorrhage. Naproxen treatment given in late pregnancy to delay parturition has been associated with persistent pulmonary hypertension, renal dysfunction, and abnormal prostaglandin E levels in preterm infants. Because of the known effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the fetal cardiovascular system (closure of ductus arteriosus), use during pregnancy (particularly starting at 30-weeks of gestation, or third trimester) should be avoided. Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Published literature reports that the use of NSAIDs at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis. Methodological limitations of these postmarketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain. Animal Data Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at 20 mg/kg/day (0.13 times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 1500 mg/day based on body surface area comparison), rabbits at 20 mg/kg/day (0.26 times the maximum recommended human daily dose, based on body surface area comparison), and mice at 170 mg/kg/day (0.6 times the maximum recommended human daily dose based on body surface area comparison) with no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to the drug. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary The naproxen anion has been found in the milk of lactating women at a concentration equivalent to approximately 1% of maximum naproxen concentration in plasma. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Females Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women. Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years have not been established. Pediatric dosing recommendations for polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis are based on well-controlled studies [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ]. There are no adequate effectiveness or dose-response data for other pediatric conditions, but the experience in polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and other use experience have established that single doses of 2.5 to 5 mg/kg as naproxen suspension, with total daily dose not exceeding 15 mg/kg/day, are well tolerated in pediatric patients over 2 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use The hepatic and renal tolerability of long-term naproxen administration was studied in two double-blind clinical trials involving 586 patients. Of the patients studied, 98 patients were age 65 and older and 10 of the 98 patients were age 75 and older. NAPROXEN was administered at doses of 375 mg twice daily or 750 mg twice daily for up to 6 months. Transient abnormalities of laboratory tests assessing hepatic and renal function were noted in some patients, although there were no differences noted in the occurrence of abnormal values among different age groups. Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions. If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks, start dosing at the low end of the dosing range, and monitor patients for adverse effects [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.6 , 5.14 ) ]. Studies indicate that although total plasma concentration of naproxen is unchanged, the unbound plasma fraction of naproxen is increased in the elderly. The clinical significance of this finding is unclear, although it is possible that the increase in free naproxen concentration could be associated with an increase in the rate of adverse events per a given dosage in some elderly patients. Caution is advised when high doses are required and some adjustment of dosage may be required in elderly patients. As with other drugs used in the elderly, it is prudent to use the lowest effective dose. Experience indicates that geriatric patients may be particularly sensitive to certain adverse effects of nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs. Elderly or debilitated patients seem to tolerate peptic ulceration or bleeding less well when these events do occur. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in the geriatric population [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ]. Naproxen is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Geriatric patients may be at a greater risk for the development of a form of renal toxicity precipitated by reduced prostaglandin formation during administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) ]. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Caution is advised when high doses are required and some adjustment of dosage may be required in these patients. It is prudent to use the lowest effective dose [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 8.7 Renal Impairment Naproxen-containing products are not recommended for use in patients with moderate to severe and severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

Manage patients with symptomatic and supportive care following an NSAID overdosage. There are no specific antidotes. Consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 grams in adults, 1 to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients seen within four hours of ingestion or in patients with a large overdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage). Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Naproxen has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties. Naproxen sodium has been developed as a more rapidly absorbed formulation of naproxen for use as an analgesic. The mechanism of action of naproxen, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Naproxen is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro. Naproxen concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because naproxen is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a healthy volunteer study, 10 days of concomitant administration of naproxen 220 mg once-daily with low-dose immediate-release aspirin (81 mg) showed an interaction with the antiplatelet activity of aspirin as measured by % serum thromboxane B 2 inhibition at 24 hours following the day 10 dose [98.7% (aspirin alone) vs 93.1% (naproxen and aspirin)]. The interaction was observed even following discontinuation of naproxen on day 11 (while aspirin dose was continued) but normalized by day 13. In the same study, the interaction was greater when naproxen was administered 30 minutes prior to aspirin [98.7% vs 87.7%] and minimal when aspirin was administered 30 minutes prior to naproxen [98.7% vs 95.4%]. Following administration of naproxen 220 mg twice-daily with low-dose immediate- release aspirin (first naproxen dose given 30 minutes prior to aspirin), the interaction was minimal at 24 h following day 10 dose [98.7% vs 95.7%]. However, the interaction was more prominent after discontinuation of naproxen (washout) on day 11 [98.7% vs 84.3%] and did not normalize completely by day 13 [98.5% vs 90.7%] [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Naproxen and naproxen sodium are rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with an in vivo bioavailability of 95%. The different dosage forms of naproxen are bioequivalent in terms of extent of absorption (AUC) and peak concentration (C max ); however, the products do differ in their pattern of absorption. These differences between naproxen products are related to both the chemical form of naproxen used and its formulation. Even with the observed differences in pattern of absorption, the elimination half-life of naproxen is unchanged across products ranging from 12 to 17 hours. Steady-state levels of naproxen are reached in 4 to 5 days, and the degree of naproxen accumulation is consistent with this half-life. This suggests that the differences in pattern of release play only a negligible role in the attainment of steady-state plasma levels. Absorption Naproxen tablets/Naproxen sodium tablets: After administration of naproxen tablets, peak plasma levels are attained in 2 to 4 hours. After oral administration of naproxen sodium tablets, peak plasma levels are attained in 1 to 2 hours. The difference in rates between the two products is due to the increased aqueous solubility of the sodium salt of naproxen used in naproxen sodium tablets. Distribution Naproxen has a volume of distribution of 0.16 L/kg. At therapeutic levels naproxen is greater than 99% albumin-bound. At doses of naproxen greater than 500 mg/day there is less than proportional increase in plasma levels due to an increase in clearance caused by saturation of plasma protein binding at higher doses (average trough Css 36.5, 49.2 and 56.4 mg/L with 500, 1000 and 1500 mg daily doses of naproxen, respectively). The naproxen anion has been found in the milk of lactating women at a concentration equivalent to approximately 1% of maximum naproxen concentration in plasma [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.2 )]. Elimination Metabolism Naproxen is extensively metabolized in the liver to 6-0-desmethyl naproxen, and both parent and metabolites do not induce metabolizing enzymes. Both naproxen and 6-0-desmethyl naproxen are further metabolized to their respective acylglucuronide conjugated metabolites. Excretion The clearance of naproxen is 0.13 mL/min/kg. Approximately 95% of the naproxen from any dose is excreted in the urine, primarily as naproxen (<1%), 6-0-desmethyl naproxen (<1%) or their conjugates (66% to 92%). The plasma half-life of the naproxen anion in humans ranges from 12 to 17 hours. The corresponding half-lives of both naproxen\u2019s metabolites and conjugates are shorter than 12 hours, and their rates of excretion have been found to coincide closely with the rate of naproxen clearance from the plasma. Small amounts, 3% or less of the administered dose, are excreted in the feces. In patients with renal failure metabolites may accumulate [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) ]. Specific Populations Pediatric: In pediatric patients aged 5 to 16 years with arthritis, plasma naproxen levels following a 5 mg/kg single dose of naproxen suspension [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] were found to be similar to those found in normal adults following a 500 mg dose. The terminal half-life appears to be similar in pediatric and adult patients. Pharmacokinetic studies of naproxen were not performed in pediatric patients younger than 5 years of age. Pharmacokinetic parameters appear to be similar following administration of naproxen suspension or tablets in pediatric patients. Geriatric: Studies indicate that although total plasma concentration of naproxen is unchanged, the unbound plasma fraction of naproxen is increased in the elderly, although the unbound fraction is <1% of the total naproxen concentration. Unbound trough naproxen concentrations in elderly subjects have been reported to range from 0.12% to 0.19% of total naproxen concentration, compared with 0.05% to 0.075% in younger subjects. Hepatic Impairment: Naproxen pharmacokinetics has not been determined in subjects with hepatic insufficiency. Chronic alcoholic liver disease and probably other diseases with decreased or abnormal plasma proteins (albumin) reduce the total plasma concentration of naproxen, but the plasma concentration of unbound naproxen is increased. Renal Impairment: Naproxen pharmacokinetics has not been determined in subjects with renal insufficiency. Given that naproxen, its metabolites and conjugates are primarily excreted by the kidney, the potential exists for naproxen metabolites to accumulate in the presence of renal insufficiency. Elimination of naproxen is decreased in patients with severe renal impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Aspirin : When NSAIDs were administered with aspirin, the protein binding of NSAIDs were reduced, although the clearance of free NSAID was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions of NSAIDs with aspirin [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]."

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Naproxen has been studied in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, tendonitis and bursitis, and acute gout. Improvement in patients treated for rheumatoid arthritis was demonstrated by a reduction in joint swelling, a reduction in duration of morning stiffness, a reduction in disease activity as assessed by both the investigator and patient, and by increased mobility as demonstrated by a reduction in walking time. Generally, response to naproxen has not been found to be dependent on age, sex, severity or duration of rheumatoid arthritis. In patients with osteoarthritis, the therapeutic action of naproxen has been shown by a reduction in joint pain or tenderness, an increase in range of motion in knee joints, increased mobility as demonstrated by a reduction in walking time, and improvement in capacity to perform activities of daily living impaired by the disease. In a clinical trial comparing standard formulations of naproxen 375 mg twice a day (750 mg a day) vs 750 mg twice a day (1500 mg/day), 9 patients in the 750 mg group terminated prematurely because of adverse events. Nineteen patients in the 1500 mg group terminated prematurely because of adverse events. Most of these adverse events were gastrointestinal events. In clinical studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, naproxen has been shown to be comparable to aspirin and indomethacin in controlling the aforementioned measures of disease activity, but the frequency and severity of the milder gastrointestinal adverse effects (nausea, dyspepsia, heartburn) and nervous system adverse effects (tinnitus, dizziness, lightheadedness) were less in naproxen-treated patients than in those treated with aspirin or indomethacin. In patients with ankylosing spondylitis, naproxen has been shown to decrease night pain, morning stiffness and pain at rest. In double-blind studies the drug was shown to be as effective as aspirin, but with fewer side effects. In patients with acute gout, a favorable response to naproxen was shown by significant clearing of inflammatory changes (e.g., decrease in swelling, heat) within 24 to 48 hours, as well as by relief of pain and tenderness. Naproxen has been studied in patients with mild to moderate pain secondary to postoperative, orthopedic, postpartum episiotomy and uterine contraction pain and dysmenorrhea. Onset of pain relief can begin within 1 hour in patients taking naproxen and within 30 minutes in patients taking naproxen sodium. Analgesic effect was shown by such measures as reduction of pain intensity scores, increase in pain relief scores, decrease in numbers of patients requiring additional analgesic medication, and delay in time to remedication. The analgesic effect has been found to last for up to 12 hours. Naproxen may be used safely in combination with gold salts and/or corticosteroids; however, in controlled clinical trials, when added to the regimen of patients receiving corticosteroids, it did not appear to cause greater improvement over that seen with corticosteroids alone. Whether naproxen has a \u201csteroid-sparing\u201d effect has not been adequately studied. When added to the regimen of patients receiving gold salts, naproxen did result in greater improvement. Its use in combination with salicylates is not recommended because there is evidence that aspirin increases the rate of excretion of naproxen and data are inadequate to demonstrate that naproxen and aspirin produce greater improvement over that achieved with aspirin alone. In addition, as with other NSAIDs, the combination may result in higher frequency of adverse events than demonstrated for either product alone. In 51 Cr blood loss and gastroscopy studies with normal volunteers, daily administration of 1000 mg of naproxen as 1000 mg of naproxen or 1100 mg of naproxen sodium has been demonstrated to cause statistically significantly less gastric bleeding and erosion than 3250 mg of aspirin."

Permanently discontinue for severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs). ( 5.9 , 2.4 ) Hyperglycemia : Monitor serum glucose levels in patients with preexisting diabetes or hyperglycemia. ( 5.10 ) Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) : Interrupt treatment for suspected HLH. Discontinue treatment if HLH is confirmed. ( 5.12 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.13 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 New Primary Malignancies Cutaneous Malignancies MEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Adult) : In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] , cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cuSCCs) and keratoacanthomas occurred in 2% of patients. Basal cell carcinoma and new primary melanoma occurred in 3% and < 1% of patients, respectively. MEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Pediatric) : In the pooled safety population, new primary melanoma occurred in < 1% of patients. Perform dermatologic evaluations prior to initiation of MEKINIST when used with dabrafenib, every 2 months while on therapy, and for up to 6 months following discontinuation of the combination. Non-Cutaneous Malignancies Based on its mechanism of action, dabrafenib may promote growth and development of malignancies with activation of RAS through mutation or other mechanisms; refer to the prescribing information for dabrafenib. In the pooled safety population of MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, non-cutaneous malignancies occurred in 1% of patients. Monitor patients receiving MEKINIST and dabrafenib closely for signs or symptoms of non-cutaneous malignancies. No dose modification is required for MEKINIST in patients who develop non-cutaneous malignancies. 5.2 Hemorrhage Hemorrhages, including major hemorrhage defined as symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, can occur with MEKINIST. Fatal cases have been reported. MEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Adult) : In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] , hemorrhagic events occurred in 17% of patients; gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurred in 3% of patients; intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 0.6% of patients; fatal hemorrhage occurred in 0.5% of patients. The fatal events were cerebral hemorrhage and brainstem hemorrhage. MEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Pediatric) : In the pooled safety population, hemorrhagic events occurred in 25% of patients; the most common type of bleeding was epistaxis (16%). Serious events of bleeding occurred in 3.6% of patients and included gastrointestinal hemorrhage (1.2%), cerebral hemorrhage (0.6%), uterine hemorrhage (0.6%), post-procedural hemorrhage (0.6%), and epistaxis (0.6%). Permanently discontinue MEKINIST for all Grade 4 hemorrhagic events and for any Grade 3 hemorrhagic events that do not improve. Withhold MEKINIST for Grade 3 hemorrhagic events; if improved, resume MEKINIST at the next lower dose level. 5.3 Colitis and Gastrointestinal Perforation Colitis and gastrointestinal perforation, including fatal outcomes, have been reported in patients taking: MEKINIST Monotherapy and Administered with Dabrafenib (Adult) : In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] , colitis occurred in < 1% of patients and gastrointestinal perforation occurred in < 1% of patients. MEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Pediatric) : In the pooled safety population, colitis events occurred in < 1% of patients. Monitor patients closely for colitis and gastrointestinal perforations. 5.4 Venous Thromboembolic Events MEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Adult) : In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] , deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) occurred in 2% of patients. MEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Pediatric) : In the pooled safety population, embolism events occurred in < 1% of patients. Advise patients to immediately seek medical care if they develop symptoms of DVT or PE, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or arm or leg swelling. Permanently discontinue MEKINIST for life-threatening PE. Withhold MEKINIST for uncomplicated DVT and PE for up to 3 weeks; if improved, MEKINIST may be resumed at a lower dose level [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . 5.5 Cardiomyopathy Cardiomyopathy, including cardiac failure, can occur with MEKINIST. MEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Adult) : In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] , cardiomyopathy, defined as a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \u2265 10% from baseline and below the institutional lower limit of normal (LLN), occurred in 6% of patients. Development of cardiomyopathy resulted in dose interruption or discontinuation of MEKINIST in 3% and < 1% of patients, respectively. Cardiomyopathy resolved in 45 of 50 patients who received MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib. MEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Pediatric) : In the pooled safety population, cardiomyopathy, defined as a decrease in LVEF \u2265 10% from baseline and below the institutional LLN, occurred in 9% of patients. Assess LVEF by echocardiogram or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan before initiation of MEKINIST as a single agent or with dabrafenib, one month after initiation, and then at 2- to 3-month intervals while on treatment. For an asymptomatic absolute decrease in LVEF of 10% or greater from baseline that is below the institutional LLN, withhold MEKINIST for up to 4 weeks. If improved to normal LVEF value, resume MEKINIST at a lower dose. If no improvement to normal LVEF value within 4 weeks, permanently discontinue MEKINIST. For symptomatic cardiomyopathy or an absolute decrease in LVEF of greater than 20% from baseline that is below the institutional LLN, permanently discontinue MEKINIST [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . 5.6 Ocular Toxicities Retinal Vein Occlusion In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] of MEKINIST monotherapy, the incidence of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) was 0.6%. In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] of MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, there were no cases of RVO. RVO may lead to macular edema, decreased visual function, neovascularization, and glaucoma. Urgently (within 24 hours) perform ophthalmological evaluation for patient-reported loss of vision or other visual disturbances. Permanently discontinue MEKINIST in patients with documented RVO [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . Retinal Pigment Epithelial Detachment Retinal pigment epithelial detachment (RPED) can occur with MEKINIST. Retinal detachments may be bilateral and multifocal, occurring in the central macular region of the retina or elsewhere in the retina. In melanoma and NSCLC trials, routine monitoring of patients to detect asymptomatic RPED was not conducted; therefore, the true incidence of this finding is unknown. MEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Pediatric) : In the pooled safety population, RPED events occurred in < 1% of patients. Perform ophthalmological evaluation periodically and at any time a patient reports visual disturbances. Withhold MEKINIST if RPED is diagnosed. If resolution of the RPED is documented on repeat ophthalmological evaluation within 3 weeks, resume MEKINIST at same or reduced dose. If no improvement after 3 weeks, resume MEKINIST at reduced dose or permanently discontinue MEKINIST [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . 5.7 Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] of MEKINIST monotherapy, interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis occurred in 2% of patients. In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] of MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, ILD or pneumonitis occurred in 1% of patients. Withhold MEKINIST in patients presenting with new or progressive pulmonary symptoms and findings, including cough, dyspnea, hypoxia, pleural effusion, or infiltrates, pending clinical investigations. Permanently discontinue MEKINIST for patients diagnosed with treatment-related ILD or pneumonitis [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . 5.8 Serious Febrile Reactions Serious febrile reactions and fever of any severity accompanied by hypotension, rigors or chills, dehydration, or renal failure, can occur when MEKINIST is administered with dabrafenib. MEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Adult) : In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] , fever occurred in 58% of patients. Serious febrile reactions and fever of any severity complicated by hypotension, rigors or chills, dehydration or renal failure occurred in 5% of patients. Fever was complicated by hypotension in 4%, dehydration in 3%, syncope in 2%, renal failure in 1%, and severe chills/rigors in < 1% of patients. MEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Pediatric) : In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] , pyrexia occurred in 66% of patients. Withhold MEKINIST when used as monotherapy, and both MEKINIST and dabrafenib when used in combination, if the patient\u2019s temperature is \u2265 100.4\u00b0F. In case of recurrence, therapy can also be interrupted at the first symptom of pyrexia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Fever may be complicated by hypotension, rigors or chills, dehydration, or renal failure. Evaluate for signs and symptoms of infection and monitor serum creatinine and other evidence of renal function during and following severe pyrexia. If appropriate, MEKINIST, or both MEKINIST and dabrafenib when used in combination, may be restarted if the patient has recovered from the febrile reaction for at least 24 hours, either at same or lower dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . Administer antipyretics as secondary prophylaxis when resuming MEKINIST if patient had a prior episode of severe febrile reaction or fever associated with complications. Administer corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone 10 mg daily) for at least 5 days for second or subsequent pyrexia if temperature does not return to baseline within 3 days of onset of pyrexia, or for pyrexia associated with complications, such as dehydration, hypotension, renal failure, or severe chills/rigors, and there is no evidence of active infection. 5.9 Serious Skin Toxicities Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), which can be life-threatening or fatal, have been reported during treatment with MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . MEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Adult) : In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] , other serious skin toxicity occurred in < 1% of patients. MEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Pediatric) : In the pooled safety population, serious adverse events of skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders occurred in 1.8% of patients. Monitor for new or worsening serious skin reactions. Permanently discontinue MEKINIST for SCARs [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . For other skin toxicities, withhold MEKINIST for intolerable or severe skin toxicity. Resume MEKINIST at a lower dose in patients with improvement or recovery from skin toxicity within 3 weeks. Permanently discontinue MEKINIST if skin toxicity has not improved in 3 weeks [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . 5.10 Hyperglycemia MEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Adult) : In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] , 15% of patients with a history of diabetes who had received MEKINIST with dabrafenib required more intensive hypoglycemic therapy. Grade 3 and Grade 4 hyperglycemia occurred in 2% of patients. MEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Pediatric) : In the pooled safety population, Grade 3 and Grade 4 hyperglycemia events occurred in < 1% of patients. Monitor serum glucose levels upon initiation and as clinically appropriate when MEKINIST is administered with dabrafenib in patients with preexisting diabetes or hyperglycemia. Initiate or optimize anti-hyperglycemic medications as clinically indicated. 5.11 Risks Associated with Combination Treatment MEKINIST is indicated for use in combination with dabrafenib. Review the prescribing information for dabrafenib for information on the serious risks of dabrafenib prior to initiation of MEKINIST with dabrafenib. 5.12 Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) has been observed in the post-marketing setting when MEKINIST was administered with dabrafenib. If HLH is suspected, interrupt treatment. If HLH is confirmed, discontinue treatment and initiate appropriate management of HLH. 5.13 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, MEKINIST can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Trametinib was embryotoxic and abortifacient in rabbits at doses greater than or equal to those resulting in exposures approximately 0.3 times the human exposure at the recommended adult clinical dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with MEKINIST and for 4 months after treatment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)] ."

Adult Safety Pools The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to MEKINIST 2 mg orally, once daily as a single agent in 329 patients with various solid tumors enrolled in METRIC, MEK113583, and MEK111054. Among these 329 patients who received MEKINIST as a single agent, 33% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 9% were exposed for greater than one year. The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to MEKINIST 2 mg orally, once daily, administered in combination with dabrafenib 150 mg orally, twice daily, in 1087 patients enrolled in COMBI-d, COMBI-v, COMBI-AD, and BRF113928 with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, adjuvant melanoma, or NSCLC. Among these 1087 patients who received MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, 70% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 21% were exposed for greater than one year. Pediatric Safety Pool The pediatric pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to weight-based MEKINIST orally, once daily administered in combination with dabrafenib in 166 pediatric patients across two trials: a multi-center, open-label, multi-cohort study in pediatric patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive glioma requiring systemic therapy (Study G2201; n = 123) and a multi-center, open-label, multi-cohort study in pediatric patients with refractory or recurrent solid tumors with MAPK pathway activation (Study X2101; n = 43) [see Clinical Studies (14.6, 14.7)] . Among 166 patients who received MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, 85% were exposed for 6 months and 69% were exposed for greater than one year. The most common (> 20%) adverse reactions were pyrexia (66%), rash (54%), headache (40%), vomiting (38%), musculoskeletal pain (36%), fatigue (31%), dry skin (31%), diarrhea (30%), nausea (26%), epistaxis and other bleeding events (25%), abdominal pain (24%), and dermatitis acneiform (23%). The most common (> 2%) Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were decreased neutrophil count (20%), increased alanine aminotransferase (3.1%), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (3.1%). Unresectable or Metastatic BRAF V600E or V600K Mutation-Positive Melanoma MEKINIST as a Single Agent The safety of MEKINIST was evaluated in the METRIC study, a randomized, open-label trial of patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma who received MEKINIST (N = 211) 2 mg orally once daily or chemotherapy (N = 99) (either dacarbazine 1000 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 175 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . Patients with abnormal LVEF, history of acute coronary syndrome within 6 months, or current evidence of Class II or greater congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association) were excluded. The median duration of treatment with MEKINIST was 4.3 months. In this study, 9% of patients who received MEKINIST experienced adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of trial medication. The most frequent adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of MEKINIST were decreased LVEF, pneumonitis, renal failure, diarrhea, and rash. Adverse reactions led to dose reductions in 27% of patients treated with MEKINIST. Rash and decreased LVEF were the most frequent reasons cited for dose reductions of MEKINIST. Table 6 and Table 7 present adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, of MEKINIST as a single agent in the METRIC study. Table 6.

In both trials, patients received MEKINIST 2 mg orally once daily and dabrafenib 150 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Both trials excluded patients with abnormal LVEF, history of acute coronary syndrome within 6 months, history of Class II or greater congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association), history of RVO or RPED, QTcB interval \u2265 480 msec, uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled arrhythmias, active brain metastases, or known history of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . Among these 559 patients, 197 (35%) were exposed to MEKINIST for > 6 months to 12 months while 185 (33%) were exposed to MEKINIST for > 1 year. The median age was 55 years (range: 18 to 91), 57% were male, and 98% were White, 72% had baseline ECOG performance status of 0 and 28% had ECOG performance status of 1, 64% had M1c disease, 35% had elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at baseline, and 0.5% had a history of brain metastases. The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 20%) for MEKINIST in patients who received MEKINIST plus dabrafenib in the COMBI-d and COMBI-v studies were: pyrexia, nausea, rash, chills, diarrhea, vomiting, hypertension, and peripheral edema. The demographics and baseline tumor characteristics of patients enrolled in the COMBI-d study are summarized in Clinical Studies [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . Patients who received MEKINIST plus dabrafenib had a median duration of exposure of 11 months (range: 3 days to 30 months) to MEKINIST. Among the 209 patients who received MEKINIST plus dabrafenib, 26% were exposed to MEKINIST for > 6 months to 12 months while 46% were exposed to MEKINIST for > 1 year. In the COMBI-d study, adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of MEKINIST occurred in 11% of patients who received MEKINIST plus dabrafenib; the most frequent were pyrexia (1.4%) and decreased ejection fraction (1.4%). Adverse reactions leading to dose reductions of MEKINIST occurred in 18% of patients who received MEKINIST plus dabrafenib; the most frequent were pyrexia (2.9%), neutropenia (1.9%), decreased ejection fraction (1.9%), and rash (1.9%). Adverse reactions leading to dose interruptions of MEKINIST occurred in 46% of patients who received MEKINIST plus dabrafenib; the most frequent were pyrexia (18%), chills (7%), vomiting (6%), and decreased ejection fraction (4.8%).

The pyrexia management algorithm interrupted both dabrafenib and trametinib when patient\u2019s temperature is \u2265 100.4\u00b0F. Grade 3-4 pyrexia occurred in 4.3% of patients, hospitalizations due to pyrexia occurred in 5.1% of patients, pyrexia with complications (dehydration, hypotension, renal dysfunction, syncope, severe chills) occurred in 2.2% of patients, and treatment discontinuation due to pyrexia occurred in 2.5% of patients. Metastatic, BRAF V600E Mutation-Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer The safety of MEKINIST when administered with dabrafenib was evaluated in 93 patients with previously untreated (n = 36) and previously treated (n = 57) metastatic BRAF V600E mutation-positive NSCLC in a multi-center, multi-cohort, non-randomized, open-label trial (Study BRF113928). Patients received MEKINIST 2 mg orally once daily and dabrafenib 150 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The trial excluded patients with abnormal LVEF, history of acute coronary syndrome within 6 months, history of Class II or greater congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association), QTc interval \u2265 480 msec, treatment refractory hypertension, uncontrolled arrhythmias, active brain metastases, history of ILD or pneumonitis, or history or current RVO [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. Among these 93 patients, 53 (57%) were exposed to MEKINIST and dabrafenib for > 6 months and 27 (29%) were exposed to MEKINIST and dabrafenib for \u2265 1 year. The median age was 65 years (range: 41 to 91), 46% were male, 85% were White; 32% had baseline ECOG performance status of 0 and 61% had ECOG performance status of 1; 98% had non-squamous histology; and 12% were current smokers, 60% were former smokers, and 28% had never smoked. The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 20%) in these 93 patients were: pyrexia, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dry skin, decreased appetite, edema, rash, chills, hemorrhage, cough, and dyspnea. Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of MEKINIST occurred in 19% of patients; the most frequent were pyrexia (2.2%), decreased ejection fraction (2.2%), and respiratory distress (2.2%). Adverse reactions leading to dose reductions of MEKINIST occurred in 30% of patients; the most frequent were pyrexia (5%), nausea (4.3%), vomiting (4.3%), diarrhea (3.2%), and neutropenia (3.2%). Adverse reactions leading to dose interruptions of MEKINIST occurred in 57% of patients; the most frequent were pyrexia (16%), vomiting (10%), neutropenia (8%), nausea (5%), and decreased ejection fraction (5%).

Patients with low-grade glioma (LGG) who required first systemic therapy were randomized (2:1) to MEKINIST plus dabrafenib (n = 73) or carboplatin plus vincristine (n = 33). Nine patients crossed over from the carboplatin plus vincristine arm to the MEKINIST and dabrafenib arm. Pediatric patients received weight-based MEKINIST orally once daily administered in combination with dabrafenib until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Patients in the control arm received carboplatin and vincristine at doses of 175 mg/m 2 and 1.5 mg/m 2 , respectively in 10-week induction course followed by eight 6-week cycles of maintenance therapy or until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Among patients with low-grade glioma who were randomized to MEKINIST plus dabrafenib (n = 73), 95% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 71% were exposed for greater than one year. The median age of these patients was 10 years (range: 1 to 17); 60% female; 75% White, 7% Asian, 2.7% Black or African American, 4% other race, and 11% where race was unknown or not reported. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 40% of these patients. Serious adverse reactions in > 3% of patients included pyrexia (14%) and vomiting (4%). Permanent discontinuation of MEKINIST due to an adverse reaction occurred in 4% of patients.

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Do not breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) Females and Males of Reproductive Potential : May impair fertility. Counsel patients on pregnancy planning and prevention. ( 8.3 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)] and findings from animal reproduction studies, MEKINIST can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There is insufficient data in pregnant women exposed to MEKINIST to assess the risks. Trametinib was embryotoxic and abortifacient in rabbits at doses greater than or equal to those resulting in exposures approximately 0.3 times the human exposure at the recommended adult clinical dose (see Data) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In reproductive toxicity studies, administration of trametinib to rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in decreased fetal weights at doses greater than or equal to 0.031 mg/kg/day [approximately 0.3 times the human exposure at the recommended adult dose based on area under the curve (AUC)]. In rats, at a dose resulting in exposures 1.8-fold higher than the human exposure at the recommended adult dose, there was maternal toxicity and an increase in post-implantation loss. In pregnant rabbits, administration of trametinib during the period of organogenesis resulted in decreased fetal body weight and increased incidence of variations in ossification at doses greater than or equal to 0.039 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.08 times the human exposure at the recommended adult dose based on AUC). In rabbits administered trametinib at 0.15 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.3 times the human exposure at the recommended adult dose based on AUC) there was an increase in post-implantation loss, including total loss of pregnancy, compared with control animals. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of trametinib in human milk, or the effects of trametinib on the breastfed child or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with MEKINIST and for 4 months following the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating MEKINIST. Contraception Based on data from animal studies and its mechanism of action, MEKINIST can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 )]. Females Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with MEKINIST and for 4 months after the last dose. Males To avoid potential drug exposure to pregnant partners and female partners of reproductive potential, advise male patients (including those who have had vasectomies) with female partners of reproductive potential to use condoms during treatment with MEKINIST and for 4 months after the last dose. Infertility Females Advise female patients of reproductive potential that MEKINIST may impair fertility. Increased follicular cysts and decreased corpora lutea were observed in female rats at dose exposures equivalent to 0.3 times the human exposure at the recommended adult dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] . 8.4 Pediatric Use BRAF V600E Mutation-Positive Unresectable or Metastatic Solid Tumors and LGG The safety and effectiveness of MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib have been established in pediatric patients 1 year of age and older with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with BRAF V600E mutation who have progressed following prior treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options; or with LGG with BRAF V600E mutation who require systemic therapy. Use of MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib for these indications is supported by evidence from studies X2101 and G2201 that enrolled 171 patients (1 to < 18 years of age) with BRAF V600 mutation-positive advanced solid tumors, of which 4 (2.3%) patients were 1 to < 2 years of age, 39 (23%) patients were 2 to < 6 years of age, 54 (32%) patients were 6 to < 12 years of age, and 74 (43%) patients were 12 to < 18 years of age [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14.6, 14.7)] . The safety and effectiveness of MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib have not been established for these indications in pediatric patients less than 1 year old. The safety and effectiveness of MEKINIST as a single agent in pediatric patients have not been established. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data In a repeat-dose toxicity study in juvenile rats, decreased bone length and corneal dystrophy were observed at doses resulting in exposures as low as 0.3 times the human exposure at the recommended adult dose based on AUC. Additionally, a delay in sexual maturation was noted at doses resulting in exposures as low as 1.6 times the human exposure at the recommended adult dose based on AUC. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 214 patients with melanoma who received single agent MEKINIST in the METRIC study, 27% were aged 65 years and older and 4% were over 75 years old [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . This study of single agent MEKINIST in melanoma did not include sufficient numbers of geriatric patients to determine whether they respond differently from younger adults. Of the 994 patients with melanoma who received MEKINIST plus dabrafenib in the COMBI-d, COMBI-v, and COMBI-AD studies [see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2)] , 21% were aged 65 years and older and 5% were aged 75 years and older. No overall differences in the effectiveness of MEKINIST plus dabrafenib were observed in geriatric patients as compared to younger adults across these melanoma studies. The incidences of peripheral edema (26% vs. 12%) and anorexia (21% vs. 9%) increased in geriatric patients as compared to younger adults in these studies. Of the 93 patients with NSCLC who received MEKINIST in Study BRF113928, there were insufficient numbers of geriatric patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adults [see Clinical Studies (14.4)] . Of the 26 patients with ATC who received MEKINIST in Study BRF117019, 77% were aged 65 years and older and 31% were aged 75 years and older [see Clinical Studies (14.4)] . This study in ATC did not include sufficient numbers of younger adults to determine whether they respond differently compared to geriatric patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild (bilirubin \u2264 upper limit of normal (ULN) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > ULN or bilirubin > 1x to 1.5x ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment. A recommended dosage of MEKINIST has not been established for patients with moderate (bilirubin > 1.5x to 3x ULN and any AST) or severe (bilirubin > 3x to 10x ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment. Consider the risk-benefit profile of MEKINIST related to dosing prior to determining whether to administer MEKINIST to patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, 3 patients who received a starting dose of 1.5 mg orally once daily and two patients who received a starting dose of 2 mg orally once daily did not experience dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the first cycle of therapy. In patients with severe hepatic impairment, 3 patients who received a starting dose of 1 mg orally once daily did not experience DLTs during the first cycle; one patient who received a starting dose of 1.5 mg orally once daily experienced a DLT (grade 3 acneiform rash). Compared to patients with normal hepatic function, there was no increase in exposure of trametinib in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] ."

In rabbits administered trametinib at 0.15 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.3 times the human exposure at the recommended adult dose based on AUC) there was an increase in post-implantation loss, including total loss of pregnancy, compared with control animals."

        "8.4 Pediatric Use BRAF V600E Mutation-Positive Unresectable or Metastatic Solid Tumors and LGG The safety and effectiveness of MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib have been established in pediatric patients 1 year of age and older with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with BRAF V600E mutation who have progressed following prior treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options; or with LGG with BRAF V600E mutation who require systemic therapy. Use of MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib for these indications is supported by evidence from studies X2101 and G2201 that enrolled 171 patients (1 to < 18 years of age) with BRAF V600 mutation-positive advanced solid tumors, of which 4 (2.3%) patients were 1 to < 2 years of age, 39 (23%) patients were 2 to < 6 years of age, 54 (32%) patients were 6 to < 12 years of age, and 74 (43%) patients were 12 to < 18 years of age [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14.6, 14.7)] . The safety and effectiveness of MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib have not been established for these indications in pediatric patients less than 1 year old. The safety and effectiveness of MEKINIST as a single agent in pediatric patients have not been established. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data In a repeat-dose toxicity study in juvenile rats, decreased bone length and corneal dystrophy were observed at doses resulting in exposures as low as 0.3 times the human exposure at the recommended adult dose based on AUC. Additionally, a delay in sexual maturation was noted at doses resulting in exposures as low as 1.6 times the human exposure at the recommended adult dose based on AUC."

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Trametinib is a reversible inhibitor of mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2 activation and of MEK1 and MEK2 kinase activity. MEK proteins are upstream regulators of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway, which promotes cellular proliferation. BRAF V600E mutations result in constitutive activation of the BRAF pathway which includes MEK1 and MEK2. Trametinib inhibits cell growth of various BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumors in vitro and in vivo. Trametinib and dabrafenib target two different kinases in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Use of trametinib and dabrafenib in combination resulted in greater growth inhibition of BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumor cell lines in vitro and prolonged inhibition of tumor growth in BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumor xenografts compared with either drug alone. In the setting of BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer, induction of EGFR-mediated MAPK pathway re-activation has been identified as a mechanism of intrinsic resistance to BRAF inhibitors [see Indications and Usage (1.7)] . 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Administration of MEKINIST tablets 1 mg and 2 mg to patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma resulted in dose-dependent changes in tumor biomarkers, including inhibition of phosphorylated ERK, inhibition of Ki67 (a marker of cell proliferation), and increases in p27 (a marker of apoptosis). Cardiac Electrophysiology The heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) prolongation potential of trametinib was assessed in a dedicated study in 32 patients who received placebo on Day 1 and MEKINIST tablets 2 mg once daily on Days 2-14 followed by MEKINIST tablets 3 mg on Day 15. No large changes in the mean QTc interval (i.e., > 20 ms) were detected in the study. A decrease from baseline in HR by 9 beats/min (90% CI: -11.4 to -6.1) and an increase from baseline in PR by 20 ms (90% CI: 13.0 to 27.4) relative to placebo was observed at two hours post-dose in the same study. In clinical trials in patients who received MEKINIST with dabrafenib, QTc prolongation > 500 ms occurred in 0.8% of patients and QTc increased by > 60 ms from baseline in 3.8% of patients. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of trametinib were characterized following a single dose and multiple doses in patients with solid tumors and BRAF V600 mutation-positive metastatic melanoma. Following administration of MEKINIST tablets 0.125 mg (0.0625 times the approved recommended adult dosage) to 4 mg (2 times the approved recommended adult dosage) daily, both C max and AUC increase proportionally with dose. Intersubject variability in AUC and C max at steady state is 22% and 28%, respectively. Absorption The median time to achieve peak plasma concentrations (T max ) is 1.5 hours post-dose. The mean absolute bioavailability of MEKINIST tablets is 72% and MEKINIST for oral solution is 81%. Effect of Food Following administration of MEKINIST tablets, a high-fat, high-calorie meal (approximately 1000 calories) decreased trametinib AUC by 24%, C max by 70%, and delayed T max by approximately 4 hours as compared with fasted conditions. Administration of a single 2 mg dose of MEKINIST for oral solution with a low-fat, low-calorie meal (approximately 500 calories, 14 grams fat, 80 grams carbohydrates, and 12 grams protein) showed no clinically significant changes on both AUC and C max of trametinib as compared with fasted conditions. Distribution Trametinib is 97.4% bound to human plasma proteins. The apparent volume of distribution (V c /F) is 214 L. Elimination The estimated elimination half-life is 3.9 to 4.8 days. The apparent clearance is 4.9 L/h. Metabolism Trametinib is metabolized predominantly via deacetylation alone or with mono-oxygenation or in combination with glucuronidation biotransformation pathways in vitro. Deacetylation is mediated by carboxylesterases (i.e., carboxylesterase 1b/c and 2) and may also be mediated by other hydrolytic enzymes. Following a single dose of [ 14 C]-trametinib, approximately 50% of circulating radioactivity is represented as the parent compound; however, \u2265 75% of drug-related material in plasma is the parent compound based on metabolite profiling after repeat dosing of trametinib. Excretion Following oral administration of [ 14 C]-trametinib, greater than 80% of excreted radioactivity was recovered in the feces while less than 20% of excreted radioactivity was recovered in the urine with less than 0.1% of the excreted dose as parent. Specific Populations Age (18 to 93 years), sex, body weight (36 to 170 kg), and renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) have no clinically significant effect on the exposure of trametinib. There are insufficient data to evaluate potential differences in the exposure of trametinib by race or ethnicity. Pediatric Patients: The pharmacokinetics of trametinib in glioma and other solid tumors were evaluated in 244 patients aged 1 to < 18 years following a single dose or multiple doses. Pharmacokinetic parameters in patients aged 1 to < 18 years are within range of values previously observed in adults given the same dose based on weight. Weight (6 to 156 kg) was found to have a statistically significant effect on trametinib oral clearance in this population. Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Hepatic impairment (defined by bilirubin and AST levels) had no significant effect in trametinib exposure or apparent drug clearance compared with patients with normal hepatic function. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Dabrafenib on Trametinib : Coadministration of MEKINIST tablets 2 mg daily with dabrafenib resulted in no change in AUC of trametinib. Effect of Trametinib on CYP Substrates: Coadministration of MEKINIST tablets 2 mg once daily with a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate had no clinically relevant effect on the AUC and C max of the sensitive CYP3A4 substrate. Based on in vitro studies, trametinib is an inhibitor of CYP2C8, but is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 at a clinically relevant systemic concentration. Effect of Transporters on Trametinib: Trametinib is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and BSEP. Inhibition of P-gp is unlikely to result in a clinically important increase in trametinib concentrations as trametinib exhibits high passive permeability and bioavailability. Trametinib is not a substrate of BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1, OCT1, MRP2, or MATE1 in vitro. Effect of Trametinib on Transporters: Based on in vitro studies, trametinib is not an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, BSEP, MRP2, or MATE1 at a clinically relevant systemic concentration."

In the METRIC study, patients were not permitted to have more than one prior chemotherapy regimen for advanced or metastatic disease; prior treatment with a BRAF inhibitor or MEK inhibitor was not permitted. Patients were randomized to receive MEKINIST 2 mg orally once daily (N = 214) or chemotherapy (N = 108) consisting of either dacarbazine 1000 mg/m 2 intravenously every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 175 mg/m 2 intravenously every 3 weeks. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Randomization was stratified according to prior use of chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease (yes vs. no) and LDH level (normal vs. greater than ULN). Tumor tissue was evaluated for BRAF mutations at a central testing site using a clinical trial assay. Tumor samples from 289 patients (196 patients treated with MEKINIST and 93 chemotherapy-treated patients) were also tested retrospectively using an FDA-approved companion diagnostic test, THxID \u00ae -BRAF assay. The major efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by the investigator. The median age for randomized patients was 54 years, 54% were male, greater than 99% were White, and all patients had baseline ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. Most patients had metastatic disease (94%), had M1c disease (64%), had elevated LDH (36%), had no history of brain metastasis (97%), and received no prior chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease (66%). The distribution of BRAF V600 mutations was BRAF V600E (87%), V600K (12%), or both (less than 1%). The median durations of follow-up prior to initiation of alternative treatment were 4.9 months for patients treated with MEKINIST and 3.1 months for patients treated with chemotherapy. Fifty-one (47%) patients crossed over from the chemotherapy arm at the time of disease progression to receive MEKINIST. The METRIC study demonstrated a statistically significant increase in PFS in the patients treated with MEKINIST. Table 20 and Figure 1 summarize the PFS results. Table 20.

MEKINIST with Dabrafenib COMBI-d Study The safety and efficacy of MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib were evaluated in an international, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial (the COMBI-d study; NCT01584648). The COMBI-d study compared dabrafenib plus MEKINIST to dabrafenib plus placebo as first-line treatment for patients with unresectable (Stage IIIC) or metastatic (Stage IV) BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive cutaneous melanoma. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive MEKINIST 2 mg once daily plus dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily or dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily plus matching placebo. Randomization was stratified by LDH level (> ULN vs. \u2264 ULN) and BRAF mutation subtype (V600E vs. V600K). The major efficacy outcome measure was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST v1.1 with additional efficacy outcome measures of overall survival (OS) and confirmed overall response rate (ORR). In the COMBI-d study, 423 patients were randomized to MEKINIST plus dabrafenib (n = 211) or dabrafenib plus placebo (n = 212).

Eligible patients were required to have at least one measurable intracranial lesion and to have no leptomeningeal disease, parenchymal brain metastasis greater than 4 cm in diameter, ocular melanoma, or primary mucosal melanoma. Patients received MEKINIST 2 mg orally once daily and dabrafenib 150 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome measure was intracranial response rate, defined as the percentage of patients with a confirmed intracranial response per RECIST v1.1, modified to allow up to five intracranial target lesions at least 5 mm in diameter, as assessed by independent review. The COMBI-MB study enrolled 121 patients with a BRAF V600E (85%) or V600K (15%) mutation.

Intracranial metastases were asymptomatic in 87% and symptomatic in 13% of patients, 22% received prior local therapy for brain metastases, and 87% also had extracranial metastases. The intracranial response rate was 50% (95% CI: 40, 60), with a complete response rate of 4.1% and a partial response rate of 46%. The median duration of intracranial response was 6.4 months (range: 1 to 31). Of the patients with an intracranial response, 9% had stable or progressive disease as their best overall response. 14.2 Adjuvant Treatment of BRAF V600E or V600K Mutation-Positive Melanoma The efficacy of MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib was evaluated in an international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (COMBI-AD; NCT01682083) that enrolled patients with Stage III melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations as detected by the THxID \u00ae -BRAF assay and pathologic involvement of regional lymph node(s). Enrollment required complete resection of melanoma with complete lymphadenectomy within 12 weeks prior to randomization. The trial excluded patients with mucosal or ocular melanoma, unresectable in-transit metastases, distant metastatic disease, or prior systemic anti-cancer treatment, including radiotherapy. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive MEKINIST 2 mg once daily in combination with dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily or two placebos for up to 1 year. Randomization was stratified by BRAF mutation status (V600E or V600K) and American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC; 7 th Edition) Stage (IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC). The major efficacy outcome measure was relapse-free survival (RFS), defined as the time from randomization to disease recurrence (local, regional, or distant metastasis), new primary melanoma, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first as assessed by the investigator. Patients underwent imaging for tumor recurrence every 3 months for the first two years and every 6 months thereafter. In COMBI-AD, a total of 870 patients were randomized: 438 to MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib and 432 to placebo. Median age was 51 years (range: 18 to 89), 55% were male, 99% were White, and 91% had an ECOG performance status of 0. Disease characteristics were AJCC Stage IIIA (18%), Stage IIIB (41%), Stage IIIC (40%), stage unknown (1%); BRAF V600E mutation (91%), BRAF V600K mutation (9%); macroscopic lymph nodes (65%); and tumor ulceration (41%). The median duration of follow-up at the time of the primary analysis was 2.8 years. COMBI-AD showed a statistically significant improvement in RFS in patients randomized to MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib compared to those randomized to placebo. Efficacy results are presented in Table 22 and Figure 3. Table 22.

Kaplan-Meier Curves for Investigator-Assessed Relapse-Free Survival in COMBI-AD in the Adjuvant Treatment of Melanoma The median duration of follow-up at the time of the final overall survival analysis was 8.0 years. The estimated hazard ratio for overall survival was 0.80 (95% CI: 0.62, 1.01; p=0.063) with 125 events (29%) in the combination arm and 136 events (31%) in the placebo arm. Median overall survival was not estimable in both arms. 14.3 BRAF V600E Mutation-Positive Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer The safety and efficacy of dabrafenib alone or administered with MEKINIST were evaluated in a multi-center, three-cohort, non-randomized, activity-estimating, open-label trial (Study BRF113928; NCT01336634). Key eligibility criteria were locally confirmed BRAF V600E mutation-positive metastatic NSCLC, no prior exposure to BRAF or MEK inhibitor, and absence of EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement (unless patients had progression on prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy). Patients enrolled in Cohorts A and B were required to have received at least one previous platinum-based chemotherapy regimen for NSCLC with demonstrated disease progression but no more than three prior systemic regimens. Patients in Cohort C could not have received prior systemic therapy for metastatic NSCLC. Patients in Cohort A received dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily. Patients in Cohorts B and C received MEKINIST 2 mg once daily and dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily. The major efficacy outcome measure was overall response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by independent review committee (IRC) and duration of response (DoR). There were a total of 171 patients enrolled which included 78 patients enrolled in Cohort A, 57 patients enrolled in Cohort B, and 36 patients enrolled in Cohort C. The characteristics of the study population were: a median age of 66 years; 48% male; 81% White, 14% Asian, 3% Black, and 2% Hispanic; 60% former smokers, 32% never smokers, and 8% current smokers; 27% had ECOG performance status (PS) of 0, 63% had ECOG PS of 1, and 11% had ECOG PS of 2; 99% had metastatic disease of which 6% had brain metastasis at baseline and 14% had liver metastasis at baseline; 11% had systemic anti-cancer therapy in the adjuvant setting and 58% of the 135 previously treated patients had only one line of prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease; 98% had non-squamous histology. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 23. Table 23.

Trial BRF117019 excluded patients who could not swallow or retain the medication; who received prior treatment with BRAF or MEK inhibitors; with symptomatic or untreated CNS metastases; or who had airway obstruction. Patients received MEKINIST 2 mg once daily and dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily. The major efficacy outcome measure was overall response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by independent review committee (IRC) and duration of response (DoR). Thirty-six patients were enrolled and were evaluable for response in the ATC cohort. The median age was 71 years (range: 47 to 85); 44% were male, 50% White, 44% Asian; and 94% had ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. Prior anti-cancer treatments included surgery and external beam radiotherapy (83% each), and systemic therapy (67%). Efficacy results are summarized in Table 24. Table 24.

All patients received MEKINIST at a dose of 2 mg orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median age was 58 years, 63% were male, all were White, 98% had baseline ECOG PS of 0 or 1, and the distribution of BRAF V600 mutations was V600E (83%), V600K (10%), and the remaining patients had multiple V600 mutations (5%), or unknown mutational status (2%). No patient achieved a confirmed partial or complete response as determined by the clinical investigators. 14.6 BRAF V600E Mutation-Positive Unresectable or Metastatic Solid Tumors The safety and efficacy of MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib for the treatment of BRAF V600E mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic solid tumors were evaluated in Trials BRF117019, NCI-MATCH, and CTMT212X2101, and supported by results in COMBI-d, COMBI-v [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] , and BRF113928 [see Clinical Studies (14.4)] . In adult studies, patients received MEKINIST 2 mg once daily and dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily. The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR per RECIST v1.1, RANO [HGG] or modified RANO [LGG] criteria and duration of response (DoR). BRF117019 Study and NCI-MATCH Study Study BRF117019 (NCT02034110) [see Clinical Studies (14.5)] is a multi-cohort, multi-center, non-randomized, open-label trial in adult patients with selected tumors with the BRAF V600E mutation, including high-grade glioma (HGG) (n = 45), biliary tract cancer (BTC) (n = 43), low-grade glioma (LGG) (n = 13), adenocarcinoma of small intestine (ASI) (n = 3), gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) (n = 1), and anaplastic thyroid cancer [see Clinical Studies (14.5)] . Patients were enrolled based on local assessments of BRAF V600E mutation status; a central laboratory confirmed the BRAF V600E mutation in 93 of 105 patients. Arm H (EAY131-H) of the NCI-MATCH study (NCT02465060) is a single-arm, open-label study that enrolled patients with a BRAF V600E mutation. Patients with melanoma, thyroid cancer, or CRC were excluded. BRAF V600E mutation status for enrollment was determined either by central or local laboratory test. The study included adult patients with solid tumors including gastrointestinal tumors (n = 14), lung tumors (n = 7), gynecologic or peritoneal tumors (n = 6), CNS tumors (n = 4), and ameloblastoma of mandible (n = 1). Among the 131 patients enrolled in BRF117019 and NCI-MATCH with the tumor types shown in Table 25, the baseline characteristics were: median age of 51 years with 20% age 65 or older; 56% female; 85% White, 9% Asian, 3% Black, 3% other; and 37% ECOG PS of 0, 56% ECOG PS of 1, and 6% ECOG PS of 2. Of the 131 patients, 90% received prior systemic therapy. Efficacy results in patients with solid tumors are summarized in Table 25. Table 25.

Part C was a dose escalation of MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib in patients with a BRAF V600E mutation. Part D was a cohort expansion phase of MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib in patients with LGG with a BRAF V600E mutation. The major efficacy outcome measure was ORR as assessed by independent review committee per RANO criteria. The efficacy of MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib was evaluated in 48 pediatric patients, including 34 patients with LGG and 2 patients with HGG. For patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive LGG and HGG in Parts C and D, the median age was 10 years (range: 1 to 17); 50% were male, 75% White, 8% Asian, 3% Black; and 58% had Karnofsky/Lansky performance status of 100. Prior anti-cancer treatments included surgery (83%), external beam radiotherapy (2.8%), and systemic therapy (92%). The ORR was 25% (95% CI: 12%, 42%). For the 9 patients who responded, DoR was \u2265 6 months for 78% of patients and \u2265 24 months for 44% of patients. CDRB436G2201 (G2201) Study \u2013 High-Grade Glioma Cohort Study G2201 (NCT02684058) was a multi-center, randomized, open-label, Phase II study of dabrafenib and trametinib in chemotherapy-na\u00efve pediatric patients with BRAF V600E mutant low-grade glioma (LGG) and patients with relapsed or progressive BRAF V600E mutant HGG. Patients with HGG were enrolled in a single-arm cohort. The major efficacy outcome measure for the HGG cohort was ORR as assessed by independent review committee per RANO 2010 criteria. The efficacy of MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib was evaluated in 41 pediatric patients with relapsed or progressive HGG. For patients with BRAF V600E mutant HGG enrolled in the HGG cohort, the median age was 13 years (range: 2 to 17); 56% were female, 61% White, 27% Asian, 2.4% Black, and 37% had Karnofsky/Lansky performance status of 100. Prior anti-cancer treatments included surgery (98%), radiotherapy (90%), and chemotherapy (81%). The ORR was 56% (95% CI: 40, 72). The median DoR was not reached (95% CI: 9.2, NE). For the 23 patients who responded in the HGG cohort, DoR was \u2265 6 months for 78% of patients, \u2265 12 months for 48% of patients, and \u2265 24 months for 22% of patients. 14.7 BRAF V600E Mutation-Positive Low-Grade Glioma CDRB436G2201 (G2201) Study \u2013 Low-Grade Glioma Cohort The safety and efficacy of MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib for the treatment of BRAF V600E mutation-positive low-grade glioma (LGG) in pediatric patients aged 1 to < 18 years of age were evaluated in the multi-center, open-label trial (Study CDRB436G2201; NCT02684058). Patients with LGG (WHO grades 1 and 2) who required first systemic therapy were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to dabrafenib plus trametinib (D + T) or carboplatin plus vincristine (C + V). BRAF mutation status was identified prospectively via a local assessment or a central laboratory test. In addition, retrospective testing of available tumor samples by the central laboratory was performed to evaluate BRAF V600E mutation status. Patients received age- and weight-based dosing of MEKINIST and dabrafenib until loss of clinical benefit or until unacceptable toxicity. Carboplatin and vincristine were dosed based on body surface area at doses 175 mg/m 2 and 1.5 mg/m 2 (0.05 mg/kg for patients < 12 kg), respectively, as one 10-week induction course followed by eight 6-week cycles of maintenance therapy. The major efficacy outcome measure was overall response rate (ORR) by independent review based on RANO LGG (2017) criteria. Additional efficacy outcome measures were progression-free survival and overall survival. The primary analysis was performed when all patients had completed at least 32 weeks of therapy. In the LGG cohort, 110 patients were randomized to D + T (n = 73) or C + V (n = 37). Median age was 9.5 years (range: 1 to 17); 60% were female. Study G2201 showed a statistically significant improvement in ORR and PFS in patients with LGG randomized to D + T compared to those randomized to C + V. Efficacy results are shown in Table 26.

If at any time MEKINIST oral solution gets in your or your child\u2019s eyes, rinse the eyes well with cool water. Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist about how to safely throw away (dispose of) MEKINIST oral solution. When MEKINIST is prepared as an oral solution, it can be used for 35 days. Throw away any remaining oral solution after 35 days. If you spill any MEKINIST oral solution, follow the instructions at the end of this \"Instructions for Use\" in the section called \u201cHow to clean up any spilled MEKINIST oral solution.\u201d The MEKINIST pack should contain: Reusable oral syringe parts: Storage of MEKINIST oral solution Store the amber bottle of MEKINIST oral solution at room temperature below 77\u00b0F (25\u00b0C). Do not freeze MEKINIST oral solution. Store the amber bottle of MEKINIST oral solution upright with the cap tightly closed. Keep MEKINIST oral solution in the carton it comes in and away from direct moisture and light. When MEKINIST is prepared as an oral solution, it can be used for 35 days. Throw away any remaining oral solution after 35 days. Do not use MEKINIST oral solution after the expiration or \u201cdiscard after\u201d date written or printed on the label by the pharmacist. Keep MEKINIST oral solution and all medicines out of the reach of children. Storage of oral syringe Store the oral syringe with the MEKINIST oral solution. Keep oral syringe out of the reach of children. Section A. Measuring and giving a dose of MEKINIST oral solution Gather your supplies: To give a dose of MEKINIST oral solution, you will need: 1 bottle adapter (already inserted into the bottle neck) 1 amber bottle containing MEKINIST oral solution 1 reusable oral syringe Call your healthcare provider or pharmacist if you do not have one or more of these items. If any of the MEKINIST oral solution comes into contact with your skin or eyes when you are following the steps below, follow the instructions in the section \u201c Important information you need to know before giving MEKINIST oral solution \u201d above. If any MEKINIST oral solution spills, follow the instructions in the section \u201c How to clean up any spilled MEKINIST oral solution \u201d at the end of this \"Instructions for Use.\" Step 1. Wash and dry your hands before measuring and giving a dose of MEKINIST oral solution. Step 2. Place your supplies on a clean, flat work surface. Step 3. Check if you have powder or solution in the amber bottle. If you have powder, do not give MEKINIST and contact your healthcare provider or pharmacist. Do not mix the MEKINIST powder on your own. If you have solution , continue to Step 4 below. Your pharmacist prepared the MEKINIST oral solution to an exact concentration. Do not add more water to the oral solution you receive from the pharmacy. Step 4. Check the expiration or \u201cdiscard after\u201d date of the MEKINIST oral solution that is handwritten or printed on the amber bottle label. Do not give MEKINIST oral solution if the expiration or \u201cdiscard after\u201d date has passed or there is no date on the amber bottle label. Note: If you are unsure of the expiration or \u201cdiscard after\u201d date, contact your healthcare provider or pharmacist. Step 5. Gently swirl the amber bottle for 30 seconds to mix the MEKINIST oral solution. If foam appears, put the amber bottle on a flat surface and let it sit there until the foam disappears. Step 6. When the foam has disappeared inside the amber bottle, remove the child-resistant cap by pushing down on the cap and turning it in the direction of the arrow (counter-clockwise), as shown. Then place the amber bottle back on your flat work surface. Step 7. Check if there is a bottle adapter already inserted in the bottle neck. Do not remove the bottle adapter. If not inserted, separate the bottle adapter from the oral syringe and insert it. Contact your healthcare provider if you are unsure or the bottle adapter is missing. Step 8. Next, pick up the oral syringe. Push the plunger up into the oral syringe as far as it will go to remove all the air inside. Step 9. Use one hand to hold the amber bottle containing the prepared MEKINIST oral solution steady. With your other hand, insert the tip of the oral syringe into the opening of the bottle adapter. Make sure the oral syringe is securely attached. Important: Due to air pressure, the plunger may move by itself when you measure your dose during Step 10 . Hold the end of the plunger to prevent it from moving. Step 10. Carefully turn the amber bottle upside down and pull down on the plunger to draw the MEKINIST oral solution into the oral syringe. To measure your dose, keep the tip of the oral syringe facing up. Pull down on the plunger until the top of the black stopper lines up with your prescribed dose in mLs on the oral syringe barrel. If large air bubbles appear in the oral syringe, push the MEKINIST oral solution back into the amber bottle and then pull down on the plunger again to draw up your dose. Keep doing this until there are no large air bubbles present. Small air bubbles are okay. Step 11. Continue to hold the plunger in place, and carefully turn the amber bottle upright. Put the amber bottle onto your flat work surface again. While still holding the plunger and barrel, remove the oral syringe from the bottle by gently pulling straight up. Check again to be sure that the top of the black stopper is at your prescribed dose. If not, repeat Steps 9, 10 and 11 again. Note: Your dose may be different than the dose shown in this figure. If you are giving a dose of MEKINIST oral solution by mouth, move to Step 12 . If you are giving a dose of MEKINIST oral solution through a feeding tube, go to Section B. Step 12. Important: If giving a dose of MEKINIST oral solution to a child, make sure they are sitting upright. Place the tip of the oral syringe inside the mouth. The tip should touch the inside of either cheek. Slowly push the plunger all the way down to give the full dose of MEKINIST oral solution. Warning: Giving MEKINIST oral solution directly into the throat or pushing down on the plunger too fast may cause choking. Step 13. Check to make sure that there is no MEKINIST oral solution left in the oral syringe. If there is any MEKINIST oral solution left in the oral syringe, give it. Note: If your dose in mLs is more than the oral syringe can hold, repeat Steps 8 through 14 until the total prescribed dose is given. Step 14. When finished, close the amber bottle. Do not remove the bottle adapter. Place the cap back on the amber bottle and turn it in the direction of the arrow (clockwise), as shown, to close it. Make sure the cap is securely attached onto the amber bottle. Step 15. Clean the reusable oral syringe. See the instructions in Section C \u201cCleaning the reusable oral syringe.\u201d Section B.

        "Drug Interactions In vitro studies were conducted to investigate the potential of gabapentin to inhibit the major cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4) that mediate drug and xenobiotic metabolism using isoform selective marker substrates and human liver microsomal preparations. Only at the highest concentration tested (171 mcg/mL; 1 mM) was a slight degree of inhibition (14% to 30%) of isoform CYP2A6 observed. No inhibition of any of the other isoforms tested was observed at gabapentin concentrations up to 171 mcg/mL (approximately 15 times the C max at 3600 mg/day). Gabapentin is not appreciably metabolized nor does it interfere with the metabolism of commonly coadministered antiepileptic drugs. The drug interaction data described in this section were obtained from studies involving healthy adults and adult patients with epilepsy."

      "geriatric_use": [
        "Geriatric Use The total number of patients treated with gabapentin in controlled clinical trials in patients with postherpetic neuralgia was 336, of which 102 (30%) were 65 to 74 years of age, and 168 (50%) were 75 years of age and older. There was a larger treatment effect in patients 75 years of age and older compared with younger patients who received the same dosage. Since gabapentin is almost exclusively eliminated by renal excretion, the larger treatment effect observed in patients \u226575 years may be a consequence of increased gabapentin exposure for a given dose that results from an age-related decrease in renal function. However, other factors cannot be excluded. The types and incidence of adverse events were similar across age groups except for peripheral edema and ataxia, which tended to increase in incidence with age. Clinical studies of gabapentin in epilepsy did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and dose should be adjusted based on creatinine clearance values in these patients (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, ADVERSE REACTIONS, and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION sections)."

      "precautions": [
        "PRECAUTIONS Information for Patients Inform patients of the availability of a Medication Guide, and instruct them to read the Medication Guide prior to taking gabapentin. Instruct patients to take gabapentin only as prescribed. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be counseled that AEDs, including gabapentin,may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. Patients should be advised that gabapentin may cause dizziness, somnolence and other symptoms and signs of CNS depression. Accordingly, they should be advised neither to drive a car nor to operate other complex machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on gabapentin to gauge whether or not it affects their mental and/or motor performance adversely. Patients who require concomitant treatment with morphine may experience increases in gabapentin concentrations. Patients should be carefully observed for signs of CNS depression, such as somnolence, and the dose of gabapentin or morphine should be reduced appropriately (see Drug Interactions ). Patients should be encouraged to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant. This registry is collecting information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. To enroll, patients can call the toll free number 1-888-233-2334 (see PRECAUTIONS , Pregnancy section). Laboratory Tests Clinical trials data do not indicate that routine monitoring of clinical laboratory parameters is necessary for the safe use of gabapentin. The value of monitoring gabapentin blood concentrations has not been established. Gabapentin may be used in combination with other antiepileptic drugs without concern for alteration of the blood concentrations of gabapentin or of other antiepileptic drugs. Drug Interactions In vitro studies were conducted to investigate the potential of gabapentin to inhibit the major cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4) that mediate drug and xenobiotic metabolism using isoform selective marker substrates and human liver microsomal preparations. Only at the highest concentration tested (171 mcg/mL; 1 mM) was a slight degree of inhibition (14% to 30%) of isoform CYP2A6 observed. No inhibition of any of the other isoforms tested was observed at gabapentin concentrations up to 171 mcg/mL (approximately 15 times the C max at 3600 mg/day). Gabapentin is not appreciably metabolized nor does it interfere with the metabolism of commonly coadministered antiepileptic drugs. The drug interaction data described in this section were obtained from studies involving healthy adults and adult patients with epilepsy. Phenytoin: In a single (400 mg) and multiple dose (400 mg TID) study of gabapentin in epileptic patients (N=8) maintained on phenytoin monotherapy for at least 2 months, gabapentin had no effect on the steady-state trough plasma concentrations of phenytoin and phenytoin had no effect on gabapentin pharmacokinetics. Carbamazepine: Steady-state trough plasma carbamazepine and carbamazepine 10, 11 epoxide concentrations were not affected by concomitant gabapentin (400 mg TID; N=12) administration. Likewise, gabapentin pharmacokinetics were unaltered by carbamazepine administration. Valproic Acid: The mean steady-state trough serum valproic acid concentrations prior to and during concomitant gabapentin administration (400 mg TID; N=17) were not different and neither were gabapentin pharmacokinetic parameters affected by valproic acid. Phenobarbital: Estimates of steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters for phenobarbital or gabapentin (300 mg TID; N=12) are identical whether the drugs are administered alone or together. Naproxen: Coadministration (N=18) of naproxen sodium capsules (250 mg) with gabapentin (125 mg) appears to increase the amount of gabapentin absorbed by 12% to 15%. Gabapentin had no effect on naproxen pharmacokinetic parameters. These doses are lower than the therapeutic doses for both drugs. The magnitude of interaction within the recommended dose ranges of either drug is not known. Hydrocodone: Coadministration of gabapentin (125 to 500 mg; N=48) decreases hydrocodone (10 mg; N=50) C max and AUC values in a dose-dependent manner relative to administration of hydrocodone alone; C max and AUC values are 3% to 4% lower, respectively, after administration of 125 mg gabapentin and 21 % to 22% lower, respectively, after administration of 500 mg gabapentin. The mechanism for this interaction is unknown. Hydrocodone increases gabapentin AUC values by 14%. The magnitude of interaction at other doses is not known. Morphine: A literature article reported that when a 60 mg controlled-release morphine capsule was administered 2 hours prior to a 600 mg gabapentin capsule (N = 12), mean gabapentin AUC increased by 44% compared to gabapentin administered without morphine (see PRECAUTIONS ). Morphine pharmacokinetic parameter values were not affected by administration of gabapentin 2 hours after morphine. The magnitude of interaction at other doses is not known. Cimetidine: In the presence of cimetidine at 300 mg QID (N=12) the mean apparent oral clearance of gabapentin fell by 14% and creatinine clearance fell by 10%. Thus cimetidine appeared to alter the renal excretion of both gabapentin and creatinine, an endogenous marker of renal function. This small decrease in excretion of gabapentin by cimetidine is not expected to be of clinical importance. The effect of gabapentin on cimetidine was not evaluated. Oral Contraceptive: Based on AUC and half-life, multiple-dose pharmacokinetic profiles of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol following administration of tablets containing 2.5 mg of norethindrone acetate and 50 mcg of ethinyl estradiol were similar with and without coadministration of gabapentin (400 mg TID; N=13). The C max of norethindrone was 13% higher when it was coadministered with gabapentin; this interaction is not expected to be of clinical importance. Antacid (Maalox \u00ae ): Maalox reduced the bioavailability of gabapentin (N=16) by about 20%. This decrease in bioavailability was about 5% when gabapentin was administered 2 hours after Maalox. It is recommended that gabapentin be taken at least 2 hours following Maalox administration. Effect of Probenecid: Probenecid is a blocker of renal tubular secretion. Gabapentin pharmacokinetic parameters without and with probenecid were comparable. This indicates that gabapentin does not undergo renal tubular secretion by the pathway that is blocked by probenecid. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Because false positive readings were reported with the Ames N-Multistix SG \u00ae dipstick test for urinary protein when gabapentin was added to other antiepileptic drugs, the more specific sulfosalicylic acid precipitation procedure is recommended to determine the presence of urine protein. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Gabapentin was given in the diet to mice at 200, 600, and 2000 mg/kg/day and to rats at 250, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg/day for 2 years. A statistically significant increase in the incidence of pancreatic acinar cell adenomas and carcinomas was found in male rats receiving the high dose; the no-effect dose for the occurrence of carcinomas was 1000 mg/kg/day. Peak plasma concentrations of gabapentin in rats receiving the high dose of 2000 mg/kg were 10 times higher than plasma concentrations in humans receiving 3600 mg per day, and in rats receiving 1000 mg/kg/day peak plasma concentrations were 6.5 times higher than in humans receiving 3600 mg/day. The pancreatic acinar cell carcinomas did not affect survival, did not metastasize and were not locally invasive. The relevance of this finding to carcinogenic risk in humans is unclear. Studies designed to investigate the mechanism of gabapentin-induced pancreatic carcinogenesis in rats indicate that gabapentin stimulates DNA synthesis in rat pancreatic acinar cells in vitro and, thus, may be acting as a tumor promoter by enhancing mitogenic activity. It is not known whether gabapentin has the ability to increase cell proliferation in other cell types or in other species, including humans. Gabapentin did not demonstrate mutagenic or genotoxic potential in three in vitro and four in vivo assays. It was negative in the Ames test and the in vitro HGPRT forward mutation assay in Chinese hamster lung cells; it did not produce significant increases in chromosomal aberrations in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay; it was negative in the in vivo chromosomal aberration assay and in the in vivo micronucleus test in Chinese hamster bone marrow; it was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay; and it did not induce unscheduled DNA synthesis in hepatocytes from rats given gabapentin. No adverse effects on fertility or reproduction were observed in rats at doses up to 2000 mg/kg (approximately 5 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis). Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C: Gabapentin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rodents, causing delayed ossification of several bones in the skull, vertebrae, forelimbs, and hindlimbs. These effects occurred when pregnant mice received oral doses of 1000 or 3000 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis, or approximately 1 to 4 times the maximum dose of 3600 mg/day given to epileptic patients on a mg/m 2 basis. The no-effect level was 500 mg/kg/day or approximately \u00bd of the human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. When rats were dosed prior to and during mating, and throughout gestation, pups from all dose groups (500, 1000 and 2000 mg/kg/day) were affected. These doses are equivalent to less than approximately 1 to 5 times the maximum human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. There was an increased incidence of hydroureter and/or hydronephrosis in rats in a study of fertility and general reproductive performance at 2000 mg/kg/day with no effect at 1000 mg/kg/day, in a teratology study at 1500 mg/kg/day with no effect at 300 mg/kg/day, and in a perinatal and postnatal study at all doses studied (500, 1000 and 2000 mg/kg/day). The doses at which the effects occurred are approximately 1 to 5 times the maximum human dose of 3600 mg/day on a mg/m 2 basis; the no-effect doses were approximately 3 times (Fertility and General Reproductive Performance study) and approximately equal to (Teratogenicity study) the maximum human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. Other than hydroureter and hydronephrosis, the etiologies of which are unclear, the incidence of malformations was not increased compared to controls in offspring of mice, rats, or rabbits given doses up to 50 times (mice), 30 times (rats), and 25 times (rabbits) the human daily dose on a mg/kg basis, or 4 times (mice), 5 times (rats), or 8 times (rabbits) the human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis. In a teratology study in rabbits, an increased incidence of postimplantation fetal loss occurred in dams exposed to 60, 300, and 1500 mg/kg/day, or less than approximately 1/4 to 8 times the maximum human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. This drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. To provide information regarding the effects of in utero exposure to gabapentin, physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking gabapentin enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/. Use in Nursing Mothers Gabapentin is secreted into human milk following oral administration. A nursed infant could be exposed to a maximum dose of approximately 1 mg/kg/day of gabapentin. Because the effect on the nursing infant is unknown, gabapentin should be used in women who are nursing only if the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of gabapentin in the management of postherpetic neuralgia in pediatric patients have not been established. Effectiveness as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial seizures in pediatric patients below the age of 3 years has not been established (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies ). Geriatric Use The total number of patients treated with gabapentin in controlled clinical trials in patients with postherpetic neuralgia was 336, of which 102 (30%) were 65 to 74 years of age, and 168 (50%) were 75 years of age and older. There was a larger treatment effect in patients 75 years of age and older compared with younger patients who received the same dosage. Since gabapentin is almost exclusively eliminated by renal excretion, the larger treatment effect observed in patients \u226575 years may be a consequence of increased gabapentin exposure for a given dose that results from an age-related decrease in renal function. However, other factors cannot be excluded.

      "mechanism_of_action": [
        "Mechanism of Action The mechanism by which gabapentin exerts its analgesic action is unknown, but in animal models of analgesia, gabapentin prevents allodynia (pain-related behavior in response to a normally innocuous stimulus) and hyperalgesia (exaggerated response to painful stimuli). In particular, gabapentin prevents pain-related responses in several models of neuropathic pain in rats or mice (e.g., spinal nerve ligation models, streptozocin-induced diabetes model, spinal cord injury model, acute herpes zoster infection model). Gabapentin also decreases pain-related responses after peripheral inflammation (carrageenan footpad test, late phase of formalin test). Gabapentin did not alter immediate pain-related behaviors (rat tail flick test, formalin footpad acute phase, acetic acid abdominal constriction test, footpad heat irradiation test). The relevance of these models to human pain is not known. The mechanism by which gabapentin exerts its anticonvulsant action is unknown, but in animal test systems designed to detect anticonvulsant activity, gabapentin prevents seizures as do other marketed anticonvulsants. Gabapentin exhibits antiseizure activity in mice and rats in both the maximal electroshock and pentylenetetrazole seizure models and other preclinical models (e.g., strains with genetic epilepsy, etc.). The relevance of these models to human epilepsy is not known. Gabapentin is structurally related to the neurotransmitter GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) but it does not modify GABA A or GABA B radioligand binding, it is not converted metabolically into GABA or a GABA agonist, and it is not an inhibitor of GABA uptake or degradation. Gabapentin was tested in radioligand binding assays at concentrations up to 100 \u00b5M and did not exhibit affinity for a number of other common receptor sites, including benzodiazepine, glutamate, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), quisqualate, kainate, strychnine-insensitive or strychnine-sensitive glycine, alpha 1, alpha 2, or beta adrenergic, adenosine A1 or A2, cholinergic muscarinic or nicotinic, dopamine D1 or D2, histamine H1, serotonin S1 or S2, opiate mu, delta or kappa, cannabinoid 1, voltage-sensitive calcium channel sites labeled with nitrendipine or diltiazem, or at voltage-sensitive sodium channel sites labeled with batrachotoxinin A 20-alpha-benzoate. Furthermore, gabapentin did not alter the cellular uptake of dopamine, noradrenaline, or serotonin. In vitro studies with radiolabeled gabapentin have revealed a gabapentin binding site in areas of rat brain including neocortex and hippocampus. A high-affinity binding protein in animal brain tissue has been identified as an auxiliary subunit of voltage-activated calcium channels. However, functional correlates of gabapentin binding, if any, remain to be elucidated."

        "INDICATIONS & USAGE Gabapentin Tablets, USP Read the Medication Guide before you start taking gabapentin and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or treatment. What is the most important information I should know about gabapentin? Do not stop taking gabapentin without first talking to your healthcare provider. Stopping gabapentin suddenly can cause serious problems. Gabapentin can cause serious side effects including: 1. Like other antiepileptic drugs, gabapentin may cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a very small number of people, about 1 in 500. Call a healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you: thoughts about suicide or dying attempts to commit suicide new or worse depression new or worse anxiety feeling agitated or restless panic attacks trouble sleeping (insomnia) new or worse irritability acting aggressive, being angry, or violent acting on dangerous impulses an extreme increase in activity and talking (mania) other unusual changes in behavior or mood How can I watch for early symptoms of suicidal thoughts and actions? Pay attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. Keep all follow-up visits with your healthcare provider as scheduled. Call your healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you are worried about symptoms. Do not stop taking gabapentin without first talking to a healthcare provider. Stopping gabapentin suddenly can cause serious problems. Stopping a seizure medicine suddenly in a patient who has epilepsy can cause seizures that will not stop (status epilepticus). Suicidal thoughts or actions can be caused by things other than medicines. If you have suicidal thoughts or actions, your healthcare provider may check for other causes. 2. Changes in behavior and thinking - Using gabapentin in children 3 to 12 years of age can cause emotional changes, aggressive behavior, problems with concentration, restlessness, changes in school performance, and hyperactivity. What is gabapentin? Gabapentin is a prescription medicine used to treat: Pain from damaged nerves (postherpetic pain) that follows healing of shingles (a painful rash that comes after a herpes zoster infection) in adults. Partial seizures when taken together with other medicines in adults and children 3 years of age and older. Who should not take gabapentin? Do not take gabapentin if you are allergic to gabapentin or any of the other ingredients in gabapentin. See the end of this Medication Guide for a complete list of ingredients in gabapentin. What should I tell my healthcare provider before taking gabapentin? Before taking gabapentin, tell your healthcare provider if you: have or have had kidney problems or are on hemodialysis have or have had depression, mood problems, or suicidal thoughts or behavior are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if gabapentin can harm your unborn baby. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you become pregnant while taking gabapentin. You and your healthcare provider will decide if you should take gabapentin while you are pregnant. If you become pregnant while taking gabapentin, talk to your healthcare provider about registering with the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. The purpose of this registry is to collect information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. You can enroll in this registry by calling 1-888-233-2334. are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Gabapentin can pass into breast milk. You and your healthcare provider should decide how you will feed your baby while you take gabapentin. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take , including prescription and non-prescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Taking gabapentin with certain other medicines can cause side effects or affect how well they work. Do not start or stop other medicines without talking to your healthcare provider. Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them and show it to your healthcare provider and pharmacist when you get a new medicine. How should I take gabapentin? Take gabapentin exactly as prescribed. Your healthcare provider will tell you how much gabapentin to take. Do not change your dose of gabapentin without talking to your healthcare provider. If you break a tablet in half the unused half of the tablet should be taken at your next scheduled dose. Half tablets not used within several days of breaking should be thrown away. Gabapentin can be taken with or without food. If you take an antacid containing aluminum and magnesium, such as Maalox\u00ae, Mylanta\u00ae, Gelusil\u00ae, Gaviscon\u00ae, or Di-Gel\u00ae, you should wait at least 2 hours before taking your next dose of gabapentin. If you take too much gabapentin, call your healthcare provider or your local Poison Control Center right away. What should I avoid while taking gabapentin? Do not drink alcohol or take other medicines that make you sleepy or dizzy while taking gabapentin without first talking with your healthcare provider. Taking gabapentin with alcohol or drugs that cause sleepiness or dizziness may make your sleepiness or dizziness worse. Do not drive, operate heavy machinery, or do other dangerous activities until you know how gabapentin affects you. Gabapentin can slow your thinking and motor skills. What are the possible side effects of gabapentin? See \"What is the most important information I should know about gabapentin?\" The most common side effects of gabapentin include: dizziness lack of coordination viral infection feeling drowsy feeling tired fever jerky movements difficulty with speaking temporary loss of memory (amnesia) tremor difficulty with coordination double vision unusual eye movement Tell your healthcare provider if you have any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away. These are not all the possible side effects of gabapentin. For more information, ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. How should I store gabapentin? Store gabapentin tablets at 20\u00b0 to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0 to 77\u00b0F). [See USP controlled room temperature]. Keep gabapentin and all medicines out of the reach of children.

        "WARNINGS Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including gabapentin, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 2 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. TABLE 2 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing gabapentin or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events\u2013Pediatric Patients 3 to 12 Years of Age Gabapentin use in pediatric patients with epilepsy 3 to 12 years of age is associated with the occurrence of central nervous system related adverse events. The most significant of these can be classified into the following categories: 1) emotional lability (primarily behavioral problems), 2) hostility, including aggressive behaviors, 3) thought disorder, including concentration problems and change in school performance, and 4) hyperkinesia (primarily restlessness and hyperactivity). Among the gabapentin-treated patients, most of the events were mild to moderate in intensity. In controlled trials in pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age, the incidence of these adverse events was: emotional lability 6% (gabapentin-treated patients) vs 1.3% (placebo-treated patients); hostility 5.2% vs 1.3%; hyperkinesia 4.7% vs 2.9%; and thought disorder 1.7% vs 0%. One of these events, a report of hostility, was considered serious. Discontinuation of gabapentin treatment occurred in 1.3% of patients reporting emotional lability and hyperkinesia and 0.9% of gabapentin-treated patients reporting hostility and thought disorder. One placebo-treated patient (0.4%) withdrew due to emotional lability. Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Antiepileptic drugs should not be abruptly discontinued because of the possibility of increasing seizure frequency. In the placebo-controlled studies in patients > 12 years of age, the incidence of status epilepticus in patients receiving gabapentin was 0.6% (3 of 543) versus 0.5% in patients receiving placebo (2 of 378). Among the 2074 patients > 12 years of age treated with gabapentin across all studies (controlled and uncontrolled) 31 (1.5%) had status epilepticus. Of these, 14 patients had no prior history of status epilepticus either before treatment or while on other medications. Because adequate historical data are not available, it is impossible to say whether or not treatment with gabapentin is associated with a higher or lower rate of status epilepticus than would be expected to occur in a similar population not treated with gabapentin. Tumorigenic Potential In standard preclinical in vivo lifetime carcinogenicity studies, an unexpectedly high incidence of pancreatic acinar adenocarcinomas was identified in male, but not female, rats (See PRECAUTIONS , Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility ). The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Clinical experience during gabapentin's premarketing development provides no direct means to assess its potential for inducing tumors in humans. In clinical studies in adjunctive therapy in epilepsy comprising 2085 patient-years of exposure in patients > 12 years of age, new tumors were reported in 10 patients (2 breast, 3 brain, 2 lung, 1 adrenal, 1 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 1 endometrial carcinoma in situ ), and preexisting tumors worsened in 11 patients (9 brain, 1 breast, 1 prostate) during or up to 2 years following discontinuation of gabapentin. Without knowledge of the background incidence and recurrence in a similar population not treated with gabapentin, it is impossible to know whether the incidence seen in this cohort is or is not affected by treatment. Sudden and Unexplained Death in Patients With Epilepsy During the course of premarketing development of gabapentin 8 sudden and unexplained deaths were recorded among a cohort of 2203 patients treated (2103 patient-years of exposure). Some of these could represent seizure-related deaths in which the seizure was not observed, e.g., at night. This represents an incidence of 0.0038 deaths per patient-year. Although this rate exceeds that expected in a healthy population matched for age and sex, it is within the range of estimates for the incidence of sudden unexplained deaths in patients with epilepsy not receiving gabapentin (ranging from 0.0005 for the general population of epileptics to 0.003 for a clinical trial population similar to that in the gabapentin program, to 0.005 for patients with refractory epilepsy). Consequently, whether these figures are reassuring or raise further concern depends on comparability of the populations reported upon to the gabapentin cohort and the accuracy of the estimates provided. Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including gabapentin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, and/or lymphadenopathy, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Gabapentin should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established."

      "pregnancy": [
        "Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C: Gabapentin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rodents, causing delayed ossification of several bones in the skull, vertebrae, forelimbs, and hindlimbs. These effects occurred when pregnant mice received oral doses of 1000 or 3000 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis, or approximately 1 to 4 times the maximum dose of 3600 mg/day given to epileptic patients on a mg/m 2 basis. The no-effect level was 500 mg/kg/day or approximately \u00bd of the human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. When rats were dosed prior to and during mating, and throughout gestation, pups from all dose groups (500, 1000 and 2000 mg/kg/day) were affected. These doses are equivalent to less than approximately 1 to 5 times the maximum human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. There was an increased incidence of hydroureter and/or hydronephrosis in rats in a study of fertility and general reproductive performance at 2000 mg/kg/day with no effect at 1000 mg/kg/day, in a teratology study at 1500 mg/kg/day with no effect at 300 mg/kg/day, and in a perinatal and postnatal study at all doses studied (500, 1000 and 2000 mg/kg/day). The doses at which the effects occurred are approximately 1 to 5 times the maximum human dose of 3600 mg/day on a mg/m 2 basis; the no-effect doses were approximately 3 times (Fertility and General Reproductive Performance study) and approximately equal to (Teratogenicity study) the maximum human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. Other than hydroureter and hydronephrosis, the etiologies of which are unclear, the incidence of malformations was not increased compared to controls in offspring of mice, rats, or rabbits given doses up to 50 times (mice), 30 times (rats), and 25 times (rabbits) the human daily dose on a mg/kg basis, or 4 times (mice), 5 times (rats), or 8 times (rabbits) the human daily dose on a mg/m 2 basis. In a teratology study in rabbits, an increased incidence of postimplantation fetal loss occurred in dams exposed to 60, 300, and 1500 mg/kg/day, or less than approximately 1/4 to 8 times the maximum human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. This drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. To provide information regarding the effects of in utero exposure to gabapentin, physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking gabapentin enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/."

        "DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION Gabapentin tablets USP are given orally with or without food. Patients should be informed that, should they break the scored 600 or 800 mg tablet in order to administer a half-tablet, they should take the unused half-tablet as the next dose. Half-tablets not used within several days of breaking the scored tablet should be discarded. If gabapentin tablets USP dose is reduced, discontinued or substituted with an alternative medication, this should be done gradually over a minimum of 1 week (a longer time period may be needed at the discretion of the prescriber). Postherpetic Neuralgia In adults with postherpetic neuralgia, gabapentin therapy may be initiated as a single 300 mg dose on Day 1, 600 mg/day on Day 2 (divided BID), and 900 mg/day on Day 3 (divided TID). The dose can subsequently be titrated up as needed for pain relief to a daily dose of 1800 mg (divided TID). In clinical studies, efficacy was demonstrated over a range of doses from 1800 mg/day to 3600 mg/day with comparable effects across the dose range. Additional benefit of using doses greater than 1800 mg/day was not demonstrated. Epilepsy Gabapentin tablets USP, are recommended for add-on therapy in patients 3 years of age and older. Effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 3 years has not been established. Patients >12 years of age: The effective dose of gabapentin is 900 to 1800 mg/day and given in divided doses (three times a day) using 300 or 400 mg capsules, 600 or 800 mg tablets. The starting dose is 300 mg three times a day. If necessary, the dose may be increased using 300 or 400 mg capsules, 600 or 800 mg tablets three times a day up to 1800 mg/day. Dosages up to 2400 mg/day have been well tolerated in long-term clinical studies. Doses of 3600 mg/day have also been administered to a small number of patients for a relatively short duration, and have been well tolerated. The maximum time between doses in the TID schedule should not exceed 12 hours. Pediatric Patients Age 3 to 12 years: The starting dose should range from 10 to 15 mg/kg/day in 3 divided doses, and the effective dose reached by upward titration over a period of approximately 3 days. The effective dose of gabapentin in patients 5 years of age and older is 25 to 35 mg/kg/day and given in divided doses (three times a day). The effective dose in pediatric patients ages 3 and 4 years is 40 mg/kg/day and given in divided doses (three times a day) (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pediatrics ). Gabapentin may be administered as the oral solution, capsule, or tablet, or using combinations of these formulations. Dosages up to 50 mg/kg/day have been well tolerated in a long-term clinical study. The maximum time interval between doses should not exceed 12 hours. It is not necessary to monitor gabapentin plasma concentrations to optimize gabapentin therapy. Further, because there are no significant pharmacokinetic interactions among gabapentin and other commonly used antiepileptic drugs, the addition of gabapentin does not alter the plasma levels of these drugs appreciably. If gabapentin tablets are discontinued and/or an alternate anticonvulsant medication is added to the therapy, this should be done gradually over a minimum of 1 week. Dosage in Renal Impairment Creatinine clearance is difficult to measure in outpatients. In patients with stable renal function, creatinine clearance (C Cr ) can be reasonably well estimated using the equation of Cockcroft and Gault: for females C Cr =(0.85)(140-age)(weight)/[(72)(S Cr )] for males C Cr =(140-age)(weight)/[(72)(S Cr )] where age is in years, weight is in kilograms and S Cr is serum creatinine in mg/dL. Dosage adjustment in patients \u226512 years of age with compromised renal function or undergoing hemodialysis is recommended as follows (see dosing recommendations above for effective doses in each indication). TABLE 6. Gabapentin Dosage Based on Renal Function Renal Function Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) Total Daily Dose Range (mg/day) Dose Regimen (mg) \u226560 900 to 3600 300 TID 400 TID 600 TID 800 TID 1200 TID >30 to 59 400 to 1400 200 BID 300 BID 400 BID 500 BID 700 BID >15 to 29 200 to 700 200 QD 300 QD 400 QD 500 QD 700 QD 15 For patients with creatinine clearance <15 mL/min, reduce daily dose in proportion to creatinine clearance (e.g., patients with a creatinine clearance of 7.5 mL/min should receive one-half the daily dose that patients with a creatinine clearance of 15 mL/min receive). 100 to 300 100 QD 125 QD 150 QD 200 QD 300 QD Post-Hemodialysis Supplemental Dose (mg) Patients on hemodialysis should receive maintenance doses based on estimates of creatinine clearance as indicated in the upper portion of the table and a supplemental post-hemodialysis dose administered after each 4 hours of hemodialysis as indicated in the lower portion of the table. Hemodialysis 125 150 200 250 350 The use of gabapentin tablets USP in patients <12 years of age with compromised renal function has not been studied. Dosage in Elderly Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and dose should be adjusted based on creatinine clearance values in these patients."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Postherpetic Neuralgia The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of gabapentin in adults, not seen at an equivalent frequency among placebo-treated patients, were dizziness, somnolence, and peripheral edema. In the 2 controlled studies in postherpetic neuralgia, 16% of the 336 patients who received gabapentin and 9% of the 227 patients who received placebo discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. The adverse events that most frequently led to withdrawal in gabapentin-treated patients were dizziness, somnolence, and nausea. Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 3 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 1% of gabapentin-treated patients with postherpetic neuralgia participating in placebo-controlled trials and that were numerically more frequent in the gabapentin group than in the placebo group. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. TABLE 3.

There were no clinically important differences between men and women in the types and incidence of adverse events. Because there were few patients whose race was reported as other than white, there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Epilepsy The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of gabapentin in combination with other antiepileptic drugs in patients > 12 years of age, not seen at an equivalent frequency among placebo-treated patients, were somnolence, dizziness, ataxia, fatigue, and nystagmus. The most commonly observed adverse events reported with the use of gabapentin in combination with other antiepileptic drugs in pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age, not seen at an equal frequency among placebo-treated patients, were viral infection, fever, nausea and/or vomiting, somnolence, and hostility (see WARNINGS , Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events ). Approximately 7% of the 2074 patients > 12 years of age and approximately 7% of the 449 pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age who received gabapentin in premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. The adverse events most commonly associated with withdrawal in patients > 12 years of age were somnolence (1.2%), ataxia (0.8%), fatigue (0.6%), nausea and/or vomiting (0.6%), and dizziness (0.6%). The adverse events most commonly associated with withdrawal in pediatric patients were emotional lability (1.6%), hostility (1.3%), and hyperkinesia (1.1%). Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 4 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 1% of gabapentin -treated patients > 12 years of age with epilepsy participating in placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common in the gabapentin group. In these studies, either gabapentin or placebo was added to the patient's current antiepileptic drug therapy. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures, obtained when gabapentin was added to concurrent antiepileptic drug therapy, cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be directly compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, or investigators. An inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescribing physician with one basis to estimate the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied.

Among the treatment-emergent adverse events occurring at an incidence of at least 10% of gabapentin-treated patients, somnolence and ataxia appeared to exhibit a positive dose-response relationship. The overall incidence of adverse events and the types of adverse events seen were similar among men and women treated with gabapentin. The incidence of adverse events increased slightly with increasing age in patients treated with either gabapentin or placebo. Because only 3% of patients (28/921) in placebo-controlled studies were identified as nonwhite (black or other), there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Table 5 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 2% of gabapentin -treated patients age 3 to 12 years of age with epilepsy participating in placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common in the gabapentin group. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. TABLE 5.

Other Adverse Events Observed During All Clinical Trials Clinical Trials in Adults and Adolescents (Except Clinical Trials in Neuropathic Pain) Gabapentin has been administered to 4717 patients > 12 years of age during all adjunctive therapy clinical trials (except clinical trials in patients with neuropathic pain), only some of which were placebo-controlled. During these trials, all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals having adverse events, similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies presented represent the proportion of the 4717 patients > 12 years of age exposed to gabapentin who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving gabapentin. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 4 , those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.

        "Information for Patients Inform patients of the availability of a Medication Guide, and instruct them to read the Medication Guide prior to taking gabapentin. Instruct patients to take gabapentin only as prescribed. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be counseled that AEDs, including gabapentin,may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. Patients should be advised that gabapentin may cause dizziness, somnolence and other symptoms and signs of CNS depression. Accordingly, they should be advised neither to drive a car nor to operate other complex machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on gabapentin to gauge whether or not it affects their mental and/or motor performance adversely. Patients who require concomitant treatment with morphine may experience increases in gabapentin concentrations. Patients should be carefully observed for signs of CNS depression, such as somnolence, and the dose of gabapentin or morphine should be reduced appropriately (see Drug Interactions ). Patients should be encouraged to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant. This registry is collecting information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. To enroll, patients can call the toll free number 1-888-233-2334 (see PRECAUTIONS , Pregnancy section)."

        "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action The mechanism by which gabapentin exerts its analgesic action is unknown, but in animal models of analgesia, gabapentin prevents allodynia (pain-related behavior in response to a normally innocuous stimulus) and hyperalgesia (exaggerated response to painful stimuli). In particular, gabapentin prevents pain-related responses in several models of neuropathic pain in rats or mice (e.g., spinal nerve ligation models, streptozocin-induced diabetes model, spinal cord injury model, acute herpes zoster infection model). Gabapentin also decreases pain-related responses after peripheral inflammation (carrageenan footpad test, late phase of formalin test). Gabapentin did not alter immediate pain-related behaviors (rat tail flick test, formalin footpad acute phase, acetic acid abdominal constriction test, footpad heat irradiation test). The relevance of these models to human pain is not known. The mechanism by which gabapentin exerts its anticonvulsant action is unknown, but in animal test systems designed to detect anticonvulsant activity, gabapentin prevents seizures as do other marketed anticonvulsants. Gabapentin exhibits antiseizure activity in mice and rats in both the maximal electroshock and pentylenetetrazole seizure models and other preclinical models (e.g., strains with genetic epilepsy, etc.). The relevance of these models to human epilepsy is not known. Gabapentin is structurally related to the neurotransmitter GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) but it does not modify GABA A or GABA B radioligand binding, it is not converted metabolically into GABA or a GABA agonist, and it is not an inhibitor of GABA uptake or degradation. Gabapentin was tested in radioligand binding assays at concentrations up to 100 \u00b5M and did not exhibit affinity for a number of other common receptor sites, including benzodiazepine, glutamate, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), quisqualate, kainate, strychnine-insensitive or strychnine-sensitive glycine, alpha 1, alpha 2, or beta adrenergic, adenosine A1 or A2, cholinergic muscarinic or nicotinic, dopamine D1 or D2, histamine H1, serotonin S1 or S2, opiate mu, delta or kappa, cannabinoid 1, voltage-sensitive calcium channel sites labeled with nitrendipine or diltiazem, or at voltage-sensitive sodium channel sites labeled with batrachotoxinin A 20-alpha-benzoate. Furthermore, gabapentin did not alter the cellular uptake of dopamine, noradrenaline, or serotonin. In vitro studies with radiolabeled gabapentin have revealed a gabapentin binding site in areas of rat brain including neocortex and hippocampus. A high-affinity binding protein in animal brain tissue has been identified as an auxiliary subunit of voltage-activated calcium channels. However, functional correlates of gabapentin binding, if any, remain to be elucidated. Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism All pharmacological actions following gabapentin administration are due to the activity of the parent compound; gabapentin is not appreciably metabolized in humans. Oral Bioavailability: Gabapentin bioavailability is not dose proportional; i.e., as dose is increased, bioavailability decreases. Bioavailability of gabapentin is approximately 60%, 47%, 34%, 33%, and 27% following 900, 1200, 2400, 3600, and 4800 mg/day given in 3 divided doses, respectively. Food has only a slight effect on the rate and extent of absorption of gabapentin (14% increase in AUC and C max ). Distribution: Less than 3% of gabapentin circulates bound to plasma protein. The apparent volume of distribution of gabapentin after 150 mg intravenous administration is 58\u00b16 L (Mean \u00b1SD). In patients with epilepsy, steady-state predose (C min ) concentrations of gabapentin in cerebrospinal fluid were approximately 20% of the corresponding plasma concentrations. Elimination: Gabapentin is eliminated from the systemic circulation by renal excretion as unchanged drug. Gabapentin is not appreciably metabolized in humans. Gabapentin elimination half-life is 5 to 7 hours and is unaltered by dose or following multiple dosing. Gabapentin elimination rate constant, plasma clearance, and renal clearance are directly proportional to creatinine clearance (see Special Populations: Patients With Renal Insufficiency , below). In elderly patients, and in patients with impaired renal function, gabapentin plasma clearance is reduced. Gabapentin can be removed from plasma by hemodialysis. Dosage adjustment in patients with compromised renal function or undergoing hemodialysis is recommended (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Table 6 ). Special Populations: Adult Patients With Renal Insufficiency: Subjects (N=60) with renal insufficiency (mean creatinine clearance ranging from 13 to 114 mL/min) were administered single 400 mg oral doses of gabapentin. The mean gabapentin half-life ranged from about 6.5 hours (patients with creatinine clearance >60 mL/min) to 52 hours (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) and gabapentin renal clearance from about 90 mL/min (>60 mL/min group) to about 10 mL/min (<30 mL/min). Mean plasma clearance (CL/F) decreased from approximately 190 mL/min to 20 mL/min. Dosage adjustment in adult patients with compromised renal function is necessary (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Pediatric patients with renal insufficiency have not been studied. Hemodialysis: In a study in anuric adult subjects (N=11), the apparent elimination half-life of gabapentin on nondialysis days was about 132 hours; during dialysis the apparent half-life of gabapentin was reduced to 3.8 hours. Hemodialysis thus has a significant effect on gabapentin elimination in anuric subjects. Dosage adjustment in patients undergoing hemodialysis is necessary (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Hepatic Disease: Because gabapentin is not metabolized, no study was performed in patients with hepatic impairment. Age: The effect of age was studied in subjects 20 to 80 years of age. Apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of gabapentin decreased as age increased, from about 225 mL/min in those under 30 years of age to about 125 mL/min in those over 70 years of age. Renal clearance (CLr) and CLr adjusted for body surface area also declined with age; however, the decline in the renal clearance of gabapentin with age can largely be explained by the decline in renal function. Reduction of gabapentin dose may be required in patients who have age related compromised renal function. (See PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use , and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Pediatric: Gabapentin pharmacokinetics were determined in 48 pediatric subjects between the ages of 1 month and 12 years following a dose of approximately 10 mg/kg. Peak plasma concentrations were similar across the entire age group and occurred 2 to 3 hours postdose. In general, pediatric subjects between 1 month and <5 years of age achieved approximately 30% lower exposure (AUC) than that observed in those 5 years of age and older. Accordingly, oral clearance normalized per body weight was higher in the younger children. Apparent oral clearance of gabapentin was directly proportional to creatinine clearance. Gabapentin elimination half-life averaged 4.7 hours and was similar across the age groups studied. A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed in 253 pediatric subjects between 1 month and 13 years of age. Patients received 10 to 65 mg/kg/day given TID. Apparent oral clearance (CL/F) was directly proportional to creatinine clearance and this relationship was similar following a single dose and at steady state. Higher oral clearance values were observed in children <5 years of age compared to those observed in children 5 years of age and older, when normalized per body weight. The clearance was highly variable in infants <1 year of age. The normalized CL/F values observed in pediatric patients 5 years of age and older were consistent with values observed in adults after a single dose. The oral volume of distribution normalized per body weight was constant across the age range. These pharmacokinetic data indicate that the effective daily dose in pediatric patients with epilepsy ages 3 and 4 years should be 40 mg/kg/day to achieve average plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in patients 5 years of age and older receiving gabapentin at 30 mg/kg/day. (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Gender: Although no formal study has been conducted to compare the pharmacokinetics of gabapentin in men and women, it appears that the pharmacokinetic parameters for males and females are similar and there are no significant gender differences. Race: Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied. Because gabapentin is primarily renally excreted and there are no important racial differences in creatinine clearance, pharmacokinetic differences due to race are not expected. Clinical Studies Postherpetic Neuralgia Gabapentin was evaluated for the management of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) in 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter studies; N=563 patients in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population ( Table 1 ). Patients were enrolled if they continued to have pain for more than 3 months after healing of the herpes zoster skin rash. TABLE 1. Controlled PHN Studies: Duration, Dosages, and Number of Patients Study Study Duration Gabapentin (mg/day) Given in 3 divided doses (TID) Target Dose Patients Receiving Gabapentin Patients Receiving Placebo 1 8 weeks 3600 113 116 2 7 weeks 1800, 2400 223 111 Total 336 227 Each study included a 1 week baseline during which patients were screened for eligibility and a 7- or 8-week double-blind phase (3 or 4 weeks of titration and 4 weeks of fixed dose). Patients initiated treatment with titration to a maximum of 900 mg/day gabapentin over 3 days. Dosages were then to be titrated in 600 to 1200 mg/day increments at 3- to 7-day intervals to target dose over 3 to 4 weeks. In Study 1, patients were continued on lower doses if not able to achieve the target dose. During baseline and treatment, patients recorded their pain in a daily diary using an 11-point numeric pain rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). A mean pain score during baseline of at least 4 was required for randomization (baseline mean pain score for Studies 1 and 2 combined was 6.4). Analyses were conducted using the ITT population (all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study medication). Both studies showed significant differences from placebo at all doses tested. A significant reduction in weekly mean pain scores was seen by Week 1 in both studies, and significant differences were maintained to the end of treatment. Comparable treatment effects were observed in all active treatment arms. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling provided confirmatory evidence of efficacy across all doses. Figures 1 and 2 show these changes for Studies 1 and 2. The proportion of responders (those patients reporting at least 50% improvement in endpoint pain score compared with baseline) was calculated for each study (Figure 3). gabapentin-fig01 gabapentin-fig02 gabapentin-fig03 Epilepsy The effectiveness of gabapentin as adjunctive therapy (added to other antiepileptic drugs) was established in multicenter placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trials in adult and pediatric patients (3 years and older) with refractory partial seizures. Evidence of effectiveness was obtained in three trials conducted in 705 patients (age 12 years and above) and one trial conducted in 247 pediatric patients (3 to 12 years of age). The patients enrolled had a history of at least 4 partial seizures per month in spite of receiving one or more antiepileptic drugs at therapeutic levels and were observed on their established antiepileptic drug regimen during a 12 week baseline period (6 weeks in the study of pediatric patients). In patients continuing to have at least 2 (or 4 in some studies) seizures per month, gabapentin or placebo was then added on to the existing therapy during a 12 week treatment period. Effectiveness was assessed primarily on the basis of the percent of patients with a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency from baseline to treatment (the \"responder rate\" ) and a derived measure called response ratio, a measure of change defined as (T - B)/(T + B), where B is the patient\u2019s baseline seizure frequency and T is the patient\u2019s seizure frequency during treatment. Response ratio is distributed within the range -1 to +1. A zero value indicates no change while complete elimination of seizures would give a value of -1; increased seizure rates would give positive values. A response ratio of -0.33 corresponds to a 50% reduction in seizure frequency. The results given below are for all partial seizures in the intent-to-treat (all patients who received any doses of treatment) population in each study, unless otherwise indicated. One study compared gabapentin 1200 mg/day divided TID with placebo. Responder rate was 23% (14/61) in the gabapentin group and 9% (6/66) in the placebo group; the difference between groups was statistically significant. Response ratio was also better in the gabapentin group (-0.199) than in the placebo group (-0.044), a difference that also achieved statistical significance. A second study compared primarily 1200 mg/day divided TID gabapentin (N=101) with placebo (N =98). Additional smaller gabapentin dosage groups (600 mg/day, N=53; 1800 mg/day, N=54) were also studied for information regarding dose response. Responder rate was higher in the gabapentin 1200 mg/day group (16%) than in the placebo group (8%), but the difference was not statistically significant. The responder rate at 600 mg (17%) was also not significantly higher than in the placebo, but the responder rate in the 1800 mg group (26%) was statistically significantly superior to the placebo rate. Response ratio was better in the gabapentin 1200 mg/day group (-0.103) than in the placebo group (-0.022); but this difference was also not statistically significant (p = 0.224). A better response was seen in the gabapentin 600 mg/day group (-0.105) and 1800 mg/day group (-0.222) than in the 1200 mg/day group, with the 1800 mg/day group achieving statistical significance compared to the placebo group. A third study compared gabapentin 900 mg/day divided TID (N=111) and placebo (N=109). An additional gabapentin 1200 mg/day dosage group (N=52) provided dose-response data. A statistically significant difference in responder rate was seen in the gabapentin 900 mg/day group (22%) compared to that in the placebo group (10%). Response ratio was also statistically significantly superior in the gabapentin 900 mg/day group (-0.119) compared to that in the placebo group (-0.027), as was response ratio in 1200 mg/day gabapentin (-0.184) compared to placebo. Analyses were also performed in each study to examine the effect of gabapentin on preventing secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Patients who experienced a secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizure in either the baseline or in the treatment period in all three placebo-controlled studies were included in these analyses. There were several response ratio comparisons that showed a statistically significant advantage for gabapentin compared to placebo and favorable trends for almost all comparisons. Analysis of responder rate using combined data from all three studies and all doses (N=162, gabapentin; N=89, placebo) also showed a significant advantage for gabapentin over placebo in reducing the frequency of secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures. In two of the three controlled studies, more than one dose of gabapentin was used. Within each study the results did not show a consistently increased response to dose. However, looking across studies, a trend toward increasing efficacy with increasing dose is evident (see Figure 4 ). In the figure, treatment effect magnitude, measured on the Y axis in terms of the difference in the proportion of gabapentin and placebo assigned patients attaining a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency from baseline, is plotted against the daily dose of gabapentin administered (X axis). Although no formal analysis by gender has been performed, estimates of response (Response Ratio) derived from clinical trials (398 men, 307 women) indicate no important gender differences exist. There was no consistent pattern indicating that age had any effect on the response to gabapentin. There were insufficient numbers of patients of races other than Caucasian to permit a comparison of efficacy among racial groups. A fourth study in pediatric patients age 3 to 12 years compared 25 to 35 mg/kg/day gabapentin (N=118) with placebo (N = 127). For all partial seizures in the intent-to-treat population, the response ratio was statistically significantly better for the gabapentin group (-0.146) than for the placebo group (-0.079). For the same population, the responder rate for gabapentin (21 %) was not significantly different from placebo (18%). A study in pediatric patients age 1 month to 3 years compared 40 mg/kg/day gabapentin (N=38) with placebo (N=38) in patients who were receiving at least one marketed antiepileptic drug and had at least one partial seizure during the screening period (within 2 weeks prior to baseline). Patients had up to 48 hours of baseline and up to 72 hours of double-blind video EEG monitoring to record and count the occurrence of seizures. There were no statistically significant differences between treatments in either the response ratio or responder rate. gabapentin-fig04"

        "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Gabapentin was given in the diet to mice at 200, 600, and 2000 mg/kg/day and to rats at 250, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg/day for 2 years. A statistically significant increase in the incidence of pancreatic acinar cell adenomas and carcinomas was found in male rats receiving the high dose; the no-effect dose for the occurrence of carcinomas was 1000 mg/kg/day. Peak plasma concentrations of gabapentin in rats receiving the high dose of 2000 mg/kg were 10 times higher than plasma concentrations in humans receiving 3600 mg per day, and in rats receiving 1000 mg/kg/day peak plasma concentrations were 6.5 times higher than in humans receiving 3600 mg/day. The pancreatic acinar cell carcinomas did not affect survival, did not metastasize and were not locally invasive. The relevance of this finding to carcinogenic risk in humans is unclear. Studies designed to investigate the mechanism of gabapentin-induced pancreatic carcinogenesis in rats indicate that gabapentin stimulates DNA synthesis in rat pancreatic acinar cells in vitro and, thus, may be acting as a tumor promoter by enhancing mitogenic activity. It is not known whether gabapentin has the ability to increase cell proliferation in other cell types or in other species, including humans. Gabapentin did not demonstrate mutagenic or genotoxic potential in three in vitro and four in vivo assays. It was negative in the Ames test and the in vitro HGPRT forward mutation assay in Chinese hamster lung cells; it did not produce significant increases in chromosomal aberrations in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay; it was negative in the in vivo chromosomal aberration assay and in the in vivo micronucleus test in Chinese hamster bone marrow; it was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay; and it did not induce unscheduled DNA synthesis in hepatocytes from rats given gabapentin.

Hemolytic Anemia: Can occur if glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficient. Consider a non-sulfonylurea alternative. ( 5.3 ). Potential Increased Risk of Cardiovascular Mortality with Sulfonylureas: Inform patient of risks, benefits and treatment alternatives ( 5.4 ). Macrovascular Outcomes: No clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with glimepiride or any other anti-diabetic drug ( 5.5 ). 5.1 Hypoglycemia All sulfonylureas, including glimepiride, can cause severe hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. These impairments may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating other machinery. Severe hypoglycemia can lead to unconsciousness or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or death. Patients must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Use caution when initiating and increasing glimepiride tablets doses in patients who may be predisposed to hypoglycemia (e.g., the elderly, patients with renal impairment, patients on other anti-diabetic medications). Debilitated or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal, pituitary, or hepatic impairment are particularly susceptible to the hypoglycemic action of glucose-lowering medications. Hypoglycemia is also more likely to occur when caloric intake is deficient, after severe or prolonged exercise, or when alcohol is ingested. Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced in patients with autonomic neuropathy, the elderly, and in patients who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking medications or other sympatholytic agents. These situations may result in severe hypoglycemia before the patient is aware of the hypoglycemia. 5.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with glimepiride, including serious reactions such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, promptly discontinue glimepiride, assess for other potential causes for the reaction, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes. 5.3 Hemolytic Anemia Sulfonylureas can cause hemolytic anemia in patients with glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Because glimepiride tablets are a sulfonylurea, use caution in patients with G6PD deficiency and consider the use of a non-sulfonylurea alternative. There are also postmarketing reports of hemolytic anemia in patients receiving glimepiride who did not have known G6PD deficiency [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.4 Increased Risk of Cardiovascular Mortality with Sulfonylureas The administration of oral hypoglycemic drugs has been reported to be associated with increased cardiovascular mortality as compared to treatment with diet alone or diet plus insulin. This warning is based on the study conducted by the University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP), a long-term, prospective clinical trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of glucose-lowering drugs in preventing or delaying vascular complications in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes. The study involved 823 patients who were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups. UGDP reported that patients treated for 5 to 8 years with diet plus a fixed dose of tolbutamide (1.5 grams per day) had a rate of cardiovascular mortality approximately 2 and a half times that of patients treated with diet alone. A significant increase in total mortality was not observed, but the use of tolbutamide was discontinued based on the increase in cardiovascular mortality, thus limiting the opportunity for the study to show an increase in overall mortality. Despite controversy regarding the interpretation of these results, the findings of the UGDP study provide an adequate basis for this warning. The patient should be informed of the potential risks and advantages of glimepiride and of alternative modes of therapy. Although only one drug in the sulfonylurea class (tolbutamide) was included in this study, it is prudent from a safety standpoint to consider that this warning may also apply to other oral hypoglycemic drugs in this class, in view of their close similarities in mode of action and chemical structure. 5.5 Macrovascular Outcomes There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with glimepiride or any other anti-diabetic drug."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in more detail below and elsewhere in the labeling: Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Hemolytic anemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] In clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions with glimepiride were hypoglycemia, dizziness, asthenia, headache, and nausea. Common adverse reactions in clinical trials (\u22655% and more common than with placebo) include hypoglycemia, headache, nausea, and dizziness ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories, Inc. at 1-888-375-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Approximately 2,800 patients with type 2 diabetes have been treated with glimepiride in the controlled clinical trials. In these trials, approximately 1,700 patients were treated with glimepiride for at least 1 year. Table 1 summarizes adverse events, other than hypoglycemia, that were reported in 11 pooled placebo-controlled trials, whether or not considered to be possibly or probably related to study medication. Treatment duration ranged from 13 weeks to 12 months. Terms that are reported represent those that occurred at an incidence of \u22655% among glimepiride-treated patients and more commonly than in patients who received placebo. Table 1. Eleven Pooled Placebo-Controlled Trials ranging from 13 weeks to 12 months: Adverse Events (excluding hypoglycemia) Occurring in \u22655% of glimepiride-treated Patients and at a Greater Incidence than with Placebo Glimepiride doses ranged from 1 to 16 mg administered daily Glimepiride N=745 % Placebo N=294 % Headache 8.2 7.8 Accidental Injury Insufficient information to determine whether any of the accidental injury events were associated with hypoglycemia 5.8 3.4 Flu Syndrome 5.4 4.4 Nausea 5 3.4 Dizziness 5 2.4 Hypoglycemia In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial of 14 weeks duration, patients already on sulfonylurea therapy underwent a 3-week washout period then were randomized to glimepiride tablets 1 mg, 4 mg, 8 mg or placebo. Patients randomized to glimepiride tablets 4 mg or 8 mg underwent forced-titration from an initial dose of 1 mg to these final doses, as tolerated [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. The overall incidence of possible hypoglycemia (defined by the presence of at least one symptom that the investigator believed might be related to hypoglycemia; a concurrent glucose measurement was not required) was 4% for glimepiride tablets 1 mg, 17% for glimepiride tablets 4 mg, 16% for glimepiride tablets 8 mg and 0% for placebo. All of these events were self-treated. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial of 22 weeks duration, patients received a starting dose of either 1 mg glimepiride tablets or placebo daily. The dose of glimepiride tablets was titrated to a target fasting plasma glucose of 90 to 150 mg/dL. Final daily doses of glimepiride tablets were 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 or 8 mg [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. The overall incidence of possible hypoglycemia (as defined above for the 14-week trial) for glimepiride vs. placebo was 19.7% vs. 3.2%. All of these events were self-treated. Weight gain Glimepiride, like all sulfonylureas, can cause weight gain [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. Allergic Reactions In clinical trials, allergic reactions, such as pruritus, erythema, urticaria, and morbilliform or maculopapular eruptions, occurred in less than 1% of glimepiride-treated patients. These may resolve despite continued treatment with glimepiride. There are postmarketing reports of more serious allergic reactions (e.g., dyspnea, hypotension, shock) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Laboratory Tests Elevated Serum Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) In 11 pooled placebo-controlled trials of glimepiride, 1.9% of glimepiride-treated patients and 0.8% of placebo-treated patients developed serum ALT greater than 2 times the upper limit of the reference range. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of glimepiride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Hemolytic anemia in patients with and without G6PD deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Impairment of liver function (e.g., with cholestasis and jaundice), as well as hepatitis, which may progress to liver failure. Porphyria cutanea tarda, photosensitivity reactions and allergic vasculitis Leukopenia, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and pancytopenia Thrombocytopenia (including severe cases with platelet count less than 10,000/\u03bcL) and thrombocytopenic purpura Hepatic porphyria reactions and disulfiram-like reactions Hyponatremia and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), most often in patients who are on other medications or who have medical conditions known to cause hyponatremia or increase release of antidiuretic hormone Dysgeusia Alopecia"

      "drug_interactions": [
        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Certain medications may affect glucose metabolism, requiring glimepiride tablets dose adjustment and close monitoring of blood glucose ( 7.1 ). Miconazole: Severe hypoglycemia can occur when glimepiride and oral miconazole are used concomitantly. ( 7.2 ). Cytochrome P450 2C9 interactions: Inhibitors and inducers of cytochrome P450 2C9 may affect glycemic control by altering glimepiride plasma concentrations ( 7.3 ). Colesevelam: Coadministration may reduce glimepiride absorption. Glimepiride should be administered at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam ( 2.1 , 7.4 ). 7.1 Drugs Affecting Glucose Metabolism A number of medications affect glucose metabolism and may require glimepiride tablets dose adjustment and particularly close monitoring for hypoglycemia or worsening glycemic control. The following are examples of medications that may increase the glucose-lowering effect of sulfonylureas including glimepiride, increasing the susceptibility to and/or intensity of hypoglycemia: oral anti-diabetic medications, pramlintide acetate, insulin, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, H 2 receptor antagonists, fibrates, propoxyphene, pentoxifylline, somatostatin analogs, anabolic steroids and androgens, cyclophosphamide, phenyramidol, guanethidine, fluconazole, sulfinpyrazone, tetracyclines, clarithromycin, disopyramide, quinolones, and those drugs that are highly protein-bound, such as fluoxetine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, coumarins, probenecid and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. When these medications are administered to a patient receiving glimepiride, monitor the patient closely for hypoglycemia. When these medications are withdrawn from a patient receiving glimepiride, monitor the patient closely for worsening glycemic control. The following are examples of medications that may reduce the glucose-lowering effect of sulfonylureas including glimepiride, leading to worsening glycemic control: danazol, glucagon, somatropin, protease inhibitors, atypical antipsychotic medications (e.g., olanzapine and clozapine), barbiturates, diazoxide, laxatives, rifampin, thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid hormones, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics (e.g., epinephrine, albuterol, terbutaline), and isoniazid. When these medications are administered to a patient receiving glimepiride, monitor the patient closely for worsening glycemic control. When these medications are withdrawn from a patient receiving glimepiride, monitor the patient closely for hypoglycemia. Beta-blockers, clonidine, and reserpine may lead to either potentiation or weakening of glimepiride\u2019s glucose-lowering effect. Both acute and chronic alcohol intake may potentiate or weaken the glucose-lowering action of glimepiride in an unpredictable fashion. The signs of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent in patients taking sympatholytic drugs such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine. 7.2 Miconazole A potential interaction between oral miconazole and sulfonylureas leading to severe hypoglycemia has been reported. Whether this interaction also occurs with other dosage forms of miconazole is not known. 7.3 Cytochrome P450 2C9 Interactions There may be an interaction between glimepiride and inhibitors (e.g., fluconazole) and inducers (e.g., rifampin) of cytochrome P450 2C9. Fluconazole may inhibit the metabolism of glimepiride, causing increased plasma concentrations of glimepiride which may lead to hypoglycemia. Rifampin may induce the metabolism of glimepiride, causing decreased plasma concentrations of glimepiride which may lead to worsening glycemic control. 7.4 Concomitant Administration of Colesevelam Colesevelam can reduce the maximum plasma concentration and total exposure of glimepiride when the two are coadministered. However, absorption is not reduced when glimepiride is administered 4 hours prior to colesevelam. Therefore, glimepiride should be administered at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam."

      "use_in_specific_populations": [
        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pediatric Patients: Not recommended because of adverse effects on body weight and hypoglycemia ( 8.4 ). Geriatric or Renally Impaired Patients: At risk for hypoglycemia with glimepiride. Use caution in dose selection and titration, and monitor closely ( 8.5 , 8.6 ). 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from a small number of published studies and postmarketing experience with glimepiride use in pregnancy over decades have not identified any drug associated risks for major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal outcomes. However, sulfonylureas (including glimepiride) cross the placenta and have been associated with neonatal adverse reactions such as hypoglycemia. Therefore, glimepiride tablets should be discontinued at least two weeks before expected delivery (see Clinical Considerations). Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy is also associated with risks to the mother and fetus (see Clinical Considerations). In animal studies (see Data), there were no effects on embryo-fetal development following administration of glimepiride to pregnant rats and rabbits at oral doses approximately 4,000 times and 60 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area, respectively. However, fetotoxicity was observed in rats and rabbits at doses 50 times and 0.1 times the maximum human dose, respectively. The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6% to 10% in women with pregestational diabetes with a HbA 1c >7% and has been reported to be as high as 20% to 25% in women with a HbA 1c >10%. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo-fetal risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, preeclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, still birth, and macrosomia-related morbidity. Fetal/neonatal adverse reactions Neonates of women with gestational diabetes who are treated with sulfonylureas during pregnancy may be at increased risk for neonatal intensive care admission and may develop respiratory distress, hypoglycemia, birth injury, and be large for gestational age. Prolonged severe hypoglycemia, lasting 4 to 10 days, has been reported in neonates born to mothers receiving a sulfonylurea at the time of delivery and has been reported with the use of agents with a prolonged half-life. Observe newborns for symptoms of hypoglycemia and respiratory distress and manage accordingly. Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period Due to reports of prolonged severe hypoglycemia in neonates born to mothers receiving a sulfonylurea at the time of delivery, glimepiride tablets should be discontinued at least two weeks before expected delivery (see Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions). Data Animal data In animal studies, there was no increase in congenital anomalies, but an increase in fetal deaths occurred in rats and rabbits at glimepiride doses 50 times (rats) and 0.1 times (rabbits) the maximum recommended human dose (based on body surface area). This fetotoxicity was observed only at doses inducing maternal hypoglycemia and is believed to be directly related to the pharmacologic (hypoglycemic) action of glimepiride, as has been similarly noted with other sulfonylureas. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Breastfed infants of lactating women using glimepiride tablets should be monitored for symptoms of hypoglycemia (see Clinical Considerations). It is not known whether glimepiride is excreted in human milk and there are no data on the effects of glimepiride on milk production. Glimepiride is present in rat milk [see Data]. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for glimepiride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from glimepiride or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitoring for adverse reactions Monitor breastfed infants for signs of hypoglycemia (e.g., jitters, cyanosis, apnea, hypothermia, excessive sleepiness, poor feeding, seizures). Data During prenatal and postnatal studies in rats, significant concentrations of glimepiride were present in breast milk and the serum of the pups. Offspring of rats exposed to high levels of glimepiride during pregnancy and lactation developed skeletal deformities consisting of shortening, thickening, and bending of the humerus during the postnatal period. These skeletal deformations were determined to be the result of nursing from mothers exposed to glimepiride. 8.4 Pediatric Use The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of glimepiride have been evaluated in pediatric patients with type 2 diabetes as described below. Glimepiride tablets are not recommended in pediatric patients because of its adverse effects on body weight and hypoglycemia. The pharmacokinetics of a 1 mg single dose of glimepiride was evaluated in 30 patients with type 2 diabetes (male = 7; female = 23) between ages 10 and 17 years. The mean (\u00b1 SD) AUC (0-last) (339\u00b1203 ng\u2022hr/mL), C max (102\u00b148 ng/mL) and t 1/2 (3.1\u00b11.7 hours) for glimepiride were comparable to historical data from adults (AUC (0-last) 315\u00b196 ng\u2022hr/mL, C max 103\u00b134 ng/mL and t 1/2 5.3\u00b14.1 hours). The safety and efficacy of glimepiride in pediatric patients was evaluated in a single-blind, 24-week trial that randomized 272 patients (8 to 17 years of age) with type 2 diabetes to glimepiride (n=135) or metformin (n=137). Both treatment-na\u00efve patients (those treated with only diet and exercise for at least 2 weeks prior to randomization) and previously treated patients (those previously treated or currently treated with other oral antidiabetic medications for at least 3 months) were eligible to participate. Patients who were receiving oral antidiabetic agents at the time of study entry discontinued these medications before randomization without a washout period. Glimepiride was initiated at 1 mg, and then titrated up to 2, 4 or 8 mg (mean last dose 4 mg) through Week 12, targeting a self-monitored fasting fingerstick blood glucose < 126 mg/dL. Metformin was initiated at 500 mg twice daily and titrated at Week 12 up to 1000 mg twice daily (mean last dose 1365 mg). After 24 weeks, the overall mean treatment difference in HbA 1c between glimepiride and metformin was 0.2%, favoring metformin (95% confidence interval -0.3% to +0.6%). Based on these results, the trial did not meet its primary objective of showing a similar reduction in HbA 1c with glimepiride compared to metformin. Table 2.

Hypoglycemic events documented by blood glucose values <36 mg/dL were observed in 4% of pediatric patients treated with glimepiride and in 1% of pediatric patients treated with metformin. One patient in each treatment group experienced a severe hypoglycemic episode (severity was determined by the investigator based on observed signs and symptoms). 8.5 Geriatric Use In clinical trials of glimepiride, 1053 of 3491 patients (30%) were >65 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. There were no significant differences in glimepiride pharmacokinetics between patients with type 2 diabetes \u226465 years (n=49) and those >65 years (n=42) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Glimepiride is substantially excreted by the kidney. Elderly patients are more likely to have renal impairment. In addition, hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Use caution when initiating glimepiride and increasing the dose of glimepiride tablets in this patient population. 8.6 Renal Impairment To minimize the risk of hypoglycemia, the recommended starting dose of glimepiride tablets are 1 mg daily for all patients with type 2 diabetes and renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. A multiple-dose titration study was conducted in 16 patients with type 2 diabetes and renal impairment using doses ranging from 1 mg to 8 mg daily for 3 months. Baseline creatinine clearance ranged from 10 to 60 mL/min. The pharmacokinetics of glimepiride tablets were evaluated in the multiple-dose titration study and the results were consistent with those observed in patients enrolled in a single-dose study. In both studies, the relative total clearance of glimepiride increased when kidney function was impaired. Both studies also demonstrated that the elimination of the two major metabolites was reduced in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

        "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from a small number of published studies and postmarketing experience with glimepiride use in pregnancy over decades have not identified any drug associated risks for major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal outcomes. However, sulfonylureas (including glimepiride) cross the placenta and have been associated with neonatal adverse reactions such as hypoglycemia. Therefore, glimepiride tablets should be discontinued at least two weeks before expected delivery (see Clinical Considerations). Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy is also associated with risks to the mother and fetus (see Clinical Considerations). In animal studies (see Data), there were no effects on embryo-fetal development following administration of glimepiride to pregnant rats and rabbits at oral doses approximately 4,000 times and 60 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area, respectively. However, fetotoxicity was observed in rats and rabbits at doses 50 times and 0.1 times the maximum human dose, respectively. The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6% to 10% in women with pregestational diabetes with a HbA 1c >7% and has been reported to be as high as 20% to 25% in women with a HbA 1c >10%. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo-fetal risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, preeclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, still birth, and macrosomia-related morbidity. Fetal/neonatal adverse reactions Neonates of women with gestational diabetes who are treated with sulfonylureas during pregnancy may be at increased risk for neonatal intensive care admission and may develop respiratory distress, hypoglycemia, birth injury, and be large for gestational age. Prolonged severe hypoglycemia, lasting 4 to 10 days, has been reported in neonates born to mothers receiving a sulfonylurea at the time of delivery and has been reported with the use of agents with a prolonged half-life. Observe newborns for symptoms of hypoglycemia and respiratory distress and manage accordingly. Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period Due to reports of prolonged severe hypoglycemia in neonates born to mothers receiving a sulfonylurea at the time of delivery, glimepiride tablets should be discontinued at least two weeks before expected delivery (see Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions). Data Animal data In animal studies, there was no increase in congenital anomalies, but an increase in fetal deaths occurred in rats and rabbits at glimepiride doses 50 times (rats) and 0.1 times (rabbits) the maximum recommended human dose (based on body surface area). This fetotoxicity was observed only at doses inducing maternal hypoglycemia and is believed to be directly related to the pharmacologic (hypoglycemic) action of glimepiride, as has been similarly noted with other sulfonylureas."

        "8.4 Pediatric Use The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of glimepiride have been evaluated in pediatric patients with type 2 diabetes as described below. Glimepiride tablets are not recommended in pediatric patients because of its adverse effects on body weight and hypoglycemia. The pharmacokinetics of a 1 mg single dose of glimepiride was evaluated in 30 patients with type 2 diabetes (male = 7; female = 23) between ages 10 and 17 years. The mean (\u00b1 SD) AUC (0-last) (339\u00b1203 ng\u2022hr/mL), C max (102\u00b148 ng/mL) and t 1/2 (3.1\u00b11.7 hours) for glimepiride were comparable to historical data from adults (AUC (0-last) 315\u00b196 ng\u2022hr/mL, C max 103\u00b134 ng/mL and t 1/2 5.3\u00b14.1 hours). The safety and efficacy of glimepiride in pediatric patients was evaluated in a single-blind, 24-week trial that randomized 272 patients (8 to 17 years of age) with type 2 diabetes to glimepiride (n=135) or metformin (n=137). Both treatment-na\u00efve patients (those treated with only diet and exercise for at least 2 weeks prior to randomization) and previously treated patients (those previously treated or currently treated with other oral antidiabetic medications for at least 3 months) were eligible to participate. Patients who were receiving oral antidiabetic agents at the time of study entry discontinued these medications before randomization without a washout period. Glimepiride was initiated at 1 mg, and then titrated up to 2, 4 or 8 mg (mean last dose 4 mg) through Week 12, targeting a self-monitored fasting fingerstick blood glucose < 126 mg/dL. Metformin was initiated at 500 mg twice daily and titrated at Week 12 up to 1000 mg twice daily (mean last dose 1365 mg). After 24 weeks, the overall mean treatment difference in HbA 1c between glimepiride and metformin was 0.2%, favoring metformin (95% confidence interval -0.3% to +0.6%). Based on these results, the trial did not meet its primary objective of showing a similar reduction in HbA 1c with glimepiride compared to metformin. Table 2.

Hypoglycemic events documented by blood glucose values <36 mg/dL were observed in 4% of pediatric patients treated with glimepiride and in 1% of pediatric patients treated with metformin. One patient in each treatment group experienced a severe hypoglycemic episode (severity was determined by the investigator based on observed signs and symptoms)."

Severe hypoglycemic reactions constitute medical emergencies requiring immediate treatment. Severe hypoglycemia with coma, seizure, or neurological impairment can be treated with glucagon or intravenous glucose.

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Glimepiride primarily lowers blood glucose by stimulating the release of insulin from pancreatic beta cells. Sulfonylureas bind to the sulfonylurea receptor in the pancreatic beta-cell plasma membrane, leading to closure of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel, thereby stimulating the release of insulin. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In healthy subjects, the time to reach maximal effect (minimum blood glucose concentrations) was approximately 2 to 3 hours after single oral doses of glimepiride tablets. The effects of glimepiride on HbA 1c , fasting plasma glucose, and postprandial glucose have been assessed in clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Studies with single oral doses of glimepiride in healthy subjects and with multiple oral doses in patients with type 2 diabetes showed peak drug concentrations (C max ) 2 to 3 hours postdose. When glimepiride was given with meals, the mean C max and AUC (area under the curve) were decreased by 8% and 9%, respectively. Glimepiride does not accumulate in serum following multiple dosing. The pharmacokinetics of glimepiride does not differ between healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes. Clearance of glimepiride after oral administration does not change over the 1 mg to 8 mg dose range, indicating linear pharmacokinetics. In healthy subjects, the intraindividual and interindividual variabilities of glimepiride pharmacokinetic parameters were 15% to 23% and 24% to 29%, respectively. Distribution After intravenous dosing in healthy subjects, the volume of distribution (Vd) was 8.8 L (113 mL/kg), and the total body clearance (CL) was 47.8 mL/min. Protein binding was greater than 99.5%. Metabolism Glimepiride is completely metabolized by oxidative biotransformation after either an intravenous or oral dose. The major metabolites are the cyclohexyl hydroxy methyl derivative (M1) and the carboxyl derivative (M2). Cytochrome P450 2C9 is involved in the biotransformation of glimepiride to M1. M1 is further metabolized to M2 by one or several cytosolic enzymes. M2 is inactive. In animals, M1 possesses about one-third of the pharmacological activity of glimepiride, but it is unclear whether M1 results in clinically meaningful effects on blood glucose in humans. Excretion When 14 C-glimepiride was given orally to 3 healthy male subjects, approximately 60% of the total radioactivity was recovered in the urine in 7 days. M1 and M2 accounted for 80% to 90% of the radioactivity recovered in the urine. The ratio of M1 to M2 in the urine was approximately 3:2 in two subjects and 4:1 in one subject. Approximately 40% of the total radioactivity was recovered in feces. M1 and M2 accounted for about 70% (ratio of M1 to M2 was 1:3) of the radioactivity recovered in feces. No parent drug was recovered from urine or feces. After intravenous dosing in patients, no significant biliary excretion of glimepiride or its M1 metabolite was observed. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients A comparison of glimepiride pharmacokinetics in patients with type 2 diabetes \u226465 years and those >65 years was evaluated in a multiple-dose study using glimepiride tablets 6 mg daily. There were no significant differences in glimepiride pharmacokinetics between the two age groups. The mean AUC at steady state for the older patients was approximately 13% lower than that for the younger patients; the mean weight-adjusted clearance for the older patients was approximately 11% higher than that for the younger patients. Gender There were no differences between males and females in the pharmacokinetics of glimepiride when adjustment was made for differences in body weight. Race No studies have been conducted to assess the effects of race on glimepiride pharmacokinetics but in placebo-controlled trials of glimepiride in patients with type 2 diabetes, the reduction in HbA 1C was comparable in Caucasians (n = 536), blacks (n = 63), and Hispanics (n = 63). Renal Impairment In a single-dose, open-label study glimepiride tablets 3 mg was administered to patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment as estimated by creatinine clearance (CLcr): Group I consisted of 5 patients with mild renal impairment (CLcr > 50 mL/min), Group II consisted of 3 patients with moderate renal impairment (CLcr = 20 to 50 mL/min) and Group III consisted of 7 patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 20 mL/min). Although, glimepiride serum concentrations decreased with decreasing renal function, Group III had a 2.3-fold higher mean AUC for M1 and an 8.6-fold higher mean AUC for M2 compared to corresponding mean AUCs in Group I. The apparent terminal half-life (T 1/2 ) for glimepiride did not change, while the half-lives for M1 and M2 increased as renal function decreased. Mean urinary excretion of M1 plus M2 as a percentage of dose decreased from 44.4% for Group I to 21.9% for Group II and 9.3% for Group III. Hepatic Impairment It is unknown whether there is an effect of hepatic impairment on glimepiride pharmacokinetics because the pharmacokinetics of glimepiride has not been adequately evaluated in patients with hepatic impairment. Obese Patients The pharmacokinetics of glimepiride and its metabolites were measured in a single-dose study involving 28 patients with type 2 diabetes who either had normal body weight or were morbidly obese. While the t max , clearance, and volume of distribution of glimepiride in the morbidly obese patients were similar to those in the normal weight group, the morbidly obese had lower C max and AUC than those of normal body weight. The mean C max , AUC 0-24 , AUC 0-\u221e values of glimepiride in normal vs. morbidly obese patients were 547 \u00b1 218 ng/mL vs. 410 \u00b1 124 ng/mL, 3210 \u00b1 1030 hours\u00b7ng/mL vs. 2820 \u00b1 1110 hours\u00b7ng/mL and 4000 \u00b1 1320 hours\u00b7ng/mL vs. 3280 \u00b1 1360 hours\u00b7ng/mL, respectively. Drug Interactions Aspirin In a randomized, double-blind, two-period, crossover study, healthy subjects were given either placebo or aspirin 1 gram three times daily for a total treatment period of 5 days. On Day 4 of each study period, a single 1 mg dose of glimepiride tablets was administered. The glimepiride tablets doses were separated by a 14-day washout period. Coadministration of aspirin and glimepiride resulted in a 34% decrease in the mean glimepiride AUC and a 4% decrease in the mean glimepiride C max . Colesevelam Concomitant administration of colesevelam and glimepiride resulted in reductions in glimepiride AUC 0-\u221e and C max of 18% and 8%, respectively. When glimepiride was administered 4 hours prior to colesevelam, there was no significant change in glimepiride AUC 0-\u221e or C max , -6% and 3%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Drug Interactions (7.4) ]. Cimetidine and Ranitidine In a randomized, open-label, 3-way crossover study, healthy subjects received either a single 4 mg dose of glimepiride tablets alone, glimepiride with ranitidine (150 mg twice daily for 4 days; glimepiride was administered on Day 3), or glimepiride with cimetidine (800 mg daily for 4 days; glimepiride was administered on Day 3). Co-administration of cimetidine or ranitidine with a single 4 mg oral dose of glimepiride tablets did not significantly alter the absorption and disposition of glimepiride. Propranolol In a randomized, double-blind, two-period, crossover study, healthy subjects were given either placebo or propranolol 40 mg three times daily for a total treatment period of 5 days. On Day 4 of each study period, a single 2 mg dose of glimepiride tablets was administered. The glimepiride tablets doses were separated by a 14-day washout period. Concomitant administration of propranolol and glimepiride significantly increased glimepiride C max , AUC, and T 1/2 by 23%, 22%, and 15%, respectively, and decreased glimepiride CL/f by 18%. The recovery of M1 and M2 from urine was not changed. Warfarin In an open-label, two-way, crossover study, healthy subjects received 4 mg of glimepiride tablets daily for 10 days. Single 25 mg doses of warfarin were administered 6 days before starting glimepiride and on Day 4 of glimepiride administration. The concomitant administration of glimepiride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of R- and S-warfarin enantiomers. No changes were observed in warfarin plasma protein binding. Glimepiride resulted in a statistically significant decrease in the pharmacodynamic response to warfarin. The reductions in mean area under the prothrombin time (PT) curve and maximum PT values during glimepiride treatment were 3.3% and 9.9%, respectively, and are unlikely to be clinically relevant."

Distribution After intravenous dosing in healthy subjects, the volume of distribution (Vd) was 8.8 L (113 mL/kg), and the total body clearance (CL) was 47.8 mL/min. Protein binding was greater than 99.5%. Metabolism Glimepiride is completely metabolized by oxidative biotransformation after either an intravenous or oral dose. The major metabolites are the cyclohexyl hydroxy methyl derivative (M1) and the carboxyl derivative (M2). Cytochrome P450 2C9 is involved in the biotransformation of glimepiride to M1. M1 is further metabolized to M2 by one or several cytosolic enzymes. M2 is inactive. In animals, M1 possesses about one-third of the pharmacological activity of glimepiride, but it is unclear whether M1 results in clinically meaningful effects on blood glucose in humans. Excretion When 14 C-glimepiride was given orally to 3 healthy male subjects, approximately 60% of the total radioactivity was recovered in the urine in 7 days. M1 and M2 accounted for 80% to 90% of the radioactivity recovered in the urine. The ratio of M1 to M2 in the urine was approximately 3:2 in two subjects and 4:1 in one subject. Approximately 40% of the total radioactivity was recovered in feces. M1 and M2 accounted for about 70% (ratio of M1 to M2 was 1:3) of the radioactivity recovered in feces. No parent drug was recovered from urine or feces. After intravenous dosing in patients, no significant biliary excretion of glimepiride or its M1 metabolite was observed. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients A comparison of glimepiride pharmacokinetics in patients with type 2 diabetes \u226465 years and those >65 years was evaluated in a multiple-dose study using glimepiride tablets 6 mg daily. There were no significant differences in glimepiride pharmacokinetics between the two age groups. The mean AUC at steady state for the older patients was approximately 13% lower than that for the younger patients; the mean weight-adjusted clearance for the older patients was approximately 11% higher than that for the younger patients. Gender There were no differences between males and females in the pharmacokinetics of glimepiride when adjustment was made for differences in body weight. Race No studies have been conducted to assess the effects of race on glimepiride pharmacokinetics but in placebo-controlled trials of glimepiride in patients with type 2 diabetes, the reduction in HbA 1C was comparable in Caucasians (n = 536), blacks (n = 63), and Hispanics (n = 63). Renal Impairment In a single-dose, open-label study glimepiride tablets 3 mg was administered to patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment as estimated by creatinine clearance (CLcr): Group I consisted of 5 patients with mild renal impairment (CLcr > 50 mL/min), Group II consisted of 3 patients with moderate renal impairment (CLcr = 20 to 50 mL/min) and Group III consisted of 7 patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 20 mL/min). Although, glimepiride serum concentrations decreased with decreasing renal function, Group III had a 2.3-fold higher mean AUC for M1 and an 8.6-fold higher mean AUC for M2 compared to corresponding mean AUCs in Group I. The apparent terminal half-life (T 1/2 ) for glimepiride did not change, while the half-lives for M1 and M2 increased as renal function decreased. Mean urinary excretion of M1 plus M2 as a percentage of dose decreased from 44.4% for Group I to 21.9% for Group II and 9.3% for Group III. Hepatic Impairment It is unknown whether there is an effect of hepatic impairment on glimepiride pharmacokinetics because the pharmacokinetics of glimepiride has not been adequately evaluated in patients with hepatic impairment. Obese Patients The pharmacokinetics of glimepiride and its metabolites were measured in a single-dose study involving 28 patients with type 2 diabetes who either had normal body weight or were morbidly obese. While the t max , clearance, and volume of distribution of glimepiride in the morbidly obese patients were similar to those in the normal weight group, the morbidly obese had lower C max and AUC than those of normal body weight. The mean C max , AUC 0-24 , AUC 0-\u221e values of glimepiride in normal vs. morbidly obese patients were 547 \u00b1 218 ng/mL vs. 410 \u00b1 124 ng/mL, 3210 \u00b1 1030 hours\u00b7ng/mL vs. 2820 \u00b1 1110 hours\u00b7ng/mL and 4000 \u00b1 1320 hours\u00b7ng/mL vs. 3280 \u00b1 1360 hours\u00b7ng/mL, respectively. Drug Interactions Aspirin In a randomized, double-blind, two-period, crossover study, healthy subjects were given either placebo or aspirin 1 gram three times daily for a total treatment period of 5 days. On Day 4 of each study period, a single 1 mg dose of glimepiride tablets was administered. The glimepiride tablets doses were separated by a 14-day washout period. Coadministration of aspirin and glimepiride resulted in a 34% decrease in the mean glimepiride AUC and a 4% decrease in the mean glimepiride C max . Colesevelam Concomitant administration of colesevelam and glimepiride resulted in reductions in glimepiride AUC 0-\u221e and C max of 18% and 8%, respectively. When glimepiride was administered 4 hours prior to colesevelam, there was no significant change in glimepiride AUC 0-\u221e or C max , -6% and 3%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Drug Interactions (7.4) ]. Cimetidine and Ranitidine In a randomized, open-label, 3-way crossover study, healthy subjects received either a single 4 mg dose of glimepiride tablets alone, glimepiride with ranitidine (150 mg twice daily for 4 days; glimepiride was administered on Day 3), or glimepiride with cimetidine (800 mg daily for 4 days; glimepiride was administered on Day 3). Co-administration of cimetidine or ranitidine with a single 4 mg oral dose of glimepiride tablets did not significantly alter the absorption and disposition of glimepiride. Propranolol In a randomized, double-blind, two-period, crossover study, healthy subjects were given either placebo or propranolol 40 mg three times daily for a total treatment period of 5 days. On Day 4 of each study period, a single 2 mg dose of glimepiride tablets was administered. The glimepiride tablets doses were separated by a 14-day washout period. Concomitant administration of propranolol and glimepiride significantly increased glimepiride C max , AUC, and T 1/2 by 23%, 22%, and 15%, respectively, and decreased glimepiride CL/f by 18%. The recovery of M1 and M2 from urine was not changed. Warfarin In an open-label, two-way, crossover study, healthy subjects received 4 mg of glimepiride tablets daily for 10 days. Single 25 mg doses of warfarin were administered 6 days before starting glimepiride and on Day 4 of glimepiride administration. The concomitant administration of glimepiride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of R- and S-warfarin enantiomers. No changes were observed in warfarin plasma protein binding. Glimepiride resulted in a statistically significant decrease in the pharmacodynamic response to warfarin. The reductions in mean area under the prothrombin time (PT) curve and maximum PT values during glimepiride treatment were 3.3% and 9.9%, respectively, and are unlikely to be clinically relevant."

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Monotherapy A total of 304 patients with type 2 diabetes already treated with sulfonylurea therapy participated in a 14-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of glimepiride monotherapy. Patients discontinued their sulfonylurea therapy then entered a 3-week placebo washout period followed by randomization into 1 of 4 treatment groups: placebo (n=74), glimepiride tablets 1 mg (n=78), glimepiride tablets 4 mg (n=76) and glimepiride tablets 8 mg (n=76). All patients randomized to glimepiride tablets started 1 mg daily. Patients randomized to glimepiride tablets 4 mg or 8 mg had blinded, forced titration of the glimepiride tablets dose at weekly intervals, first to 4 mg and then to 8 mg, as long as the dose was tolerated, until the randomized dose was reached. Patients randomized to the 4 mg dose reached the assigned dose at Week 2. Patients randomized to the 8 mg dose reached the assigned dose at Week 3. Once the randomized dose level was reached, patients were to be maintained at that dose until Week 14. Approximately 66% of the placebo-treated patients completed the trial compared to 81% of patients treated with glimepiride 1 mg and 92% of patients treated with glimepiride 4 mg or 8 mg. Compared to placebo, treatment with glimepiride tablets 1 mg, 4 mg and 8 mg daily provided statistically significant improvements in HbA 1C compared to placebo (Table 3).

The starting dose of glimepiride tablets was 1 mg daily and was titrated upward or downward at 2-week intervals to a goal FPG of 90 to 150 mg/dL. Blood glucose levels for both FPG and PPG were analyzed in the laboratory. Following 10 weeks of dose adjustment, patients were maintained at their optimal dose (1, 2, 3, 4, 6 or 8 mg) for the remaining 12 weeks of the trial. Treatment with glimepiride provided statistically significant improvements in HbA 1C and FPG compared to placebo (Table 4).

        "Drug Interactions Clarithromycin use in patients who are receiving theophylline may be associated with an increase of serum theophylline concentrations. Monitoring of serum theophylline concentrations should be considered for patients receiving high doses of theophylline or with baseline concentrations in the upper therapeutic range. In two studies in which theophylline was administered with clarithromycin (a theophylline sustained-release formulation was dosed at either 6.5 mg/kg or 12 mg/kg together with 250 or 500 mg q12h clarithromycin), the steady-state levels of C max , C min , and the area under the serum concentration time curve (AUC) of theophylline increased about 20%. Hypotension, bradyarrhythmias, and lactic acidosis have been observed in patients receiving concurrent verapamil, belonging to the calcium channel blockers drug class. Concomitant administration of single doses of clarithromycin and carbamazepine has been shown to result in increased plasma concentrations of carbamazepine. Blood level monitoring of carbamazepine may be considered. When clarithromycin and terfenadine were coadministered, plasma concentrations of the active acid metabolite of terfenadine were threefold higher, on average, than the values observed when terfenadine was administered alone. The pharmacokinetics of clarithromycin and the 14-hydroxy-clarithromycin were not significantly affected by coadministration of terfenadine once clarithromycin reached steady-state conditions. Concomitant administration of clarithromycin with terfenadine is contraindicated. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS .) Clarithromycin 500 mg every 8 hours was given in combination with omeprazole 40 mg daily to healthy adult subjects. The steady-state plasma concentrations of omeprazole were increased (C max , AUC 0-24 , and T 1/2 increases of 30%, 89%, and 34%, respectively), by the concomitant administration of clarithromycin. The mean 24-hour gastric pH value was 5.2 when omeprazole was administered alone and 5.7 when co-administered with clarithromycin. Co-administration of clarithromycin with ranitidine bismuth citrate resulted in increased plasma ranitidine concentrations (57%), increased plasma bismuth trough concentrations (48%), and increased 14-hydroxy-clarithromycin plasma concentrations (31%). These effects are clinically insignificant. Simultaneous oral administration of clarithromycin tablets and zidovudine to HIV-infected adult patients may result in decreased steady-state zidovudine concentrations. Following administration of clarithromycin 500 mg tablets twice daily with zidovudine 100 mg every 4 hours, the steady-state zidovudine AUC decreased 12% compared to administration of zidovudine alone (n=4). Individual values ranged from a decrease of 34% to an increase of 14%. When clarithromycin tablets were administered two to four hours prior to zidovudine, the steady-state zidovudine C max increased 100% whereas the AUC was unaffected (n=24). Administration of clarithromycin and zidovudine should be separated by at least two hours. The impact of co-administration of clarithromycin extended-release tablets and zidovudine has not been evaluated. Simultaneous administration of clarithromycin tablets and didanosine to 12 HIV-infected adult patients resulted in no statistically significant change in didanosine pharmacokinetics. Following administration of fluconazole 200 mg daily and clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily to 21 healthy volunteers, the steady-state clarithromycin C min and AUC increased 33% and 18%, respectively. Steady-state concentrations of 14-OH clarithromycin were not significantly affected by concomitant administration of fluconazole. No dosage adjustment of clarithromycin is necessary when co-administered with fluconazole. Ritonavir Concomitant administration of clarithromycin and ritonavir (n=22) resulted in a 77% increase in clarithromycin AUC and a 100% decrease in the AUC of 14-OH clarithromycin. Clarithromycin may be administered without dosage adjustment to patients with normal renal function taking ritonavir. Since concentrations of 14-OH clarithromycin are significantly reduced when clarithromycin is co-administered with ritonavir, alternative antibacterial therapy should be considered for indications other than infections due to Mycobacterium avium complex (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Doses of clarithromycin greater than 1000 mg per day should not be co-administered with protease inhibitors. Spontaneous reports in the post-marketing period suggest that concomitant administration of clarithromycin and oral anticoagulants may potentiate the effects of the oral anticoagulants. Prothrombin times should be carefully monitored while patients are receiving clarithromycin and oral anticoagulants simultaneously. Digoxin is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and clarithromycin is known to inhibit Pgp. When clarithromycin and digoxin are co-administered, inhibition of Pgp by clarithromycin may lead to increased exposure of digoxin. Elevated digoxin serum concentrations in patients receiving clarithromycin and digoxin concomitantly have been reported in post-marketing surveillance. Some patients have shown clinical signs consistent with digoxin toxicity, including potentially fatal arrhythmias. Monitoring of serum digoxin concentrations should be considered, especially for patients with digoxin concentrations in the upper therapeutic range. Co-administration of clarithromycin, known to inhibit CYP3A, and a drug primarily metabolized by CYP3A may be associated with elevations in drug concentrations that could increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects of the concomitant drug. Clarithromycin should be used with caution in patients receiving treatment with other drugs known to be CYP3A enzyme substrates, especially if the CYP3A substrate has a narrow safety margin (e.g., carbamazepine) and/or the substrate is extensively metabolized by this enzyme. Dosage adjustments may be considered, and when possible, serum concentrations of drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A should be monitored closely in patients concurrently receiving clarithromycin. The following are examples of some clinically significant CYP3A based drug interactions. Interactions with other drugs metabolized by the CYP3A isoform are also possible. Carbamazepine and Terfenadine Increased serum concentrations of carbamazepine and the active acid metabolite of terfenadine were observed in clinical trials with clarithromycin. Colchicine Colchicine is a substrate for both CYP3A and the efflux transporter, P-glycoprotein (Pgp). Clarithromycin and other macrolides are known to inhibit CYP3A and Pgp. When a single dose of colchicine 0.6 mg was administered with clarithromycin 250 mg BID for 7 days, the colchicine C max increased 197% and the AUC0-\u221e increased 239% compared to administration of colchicine alone. The dose of colchicine should be reduced when co-administered with clarithromycin in patients with normal renal and hepatic function. Concomitant use of clarithromycin and colchicine is contraindicated in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. (See WARNINGS ). Efavirenz, Nevirapine, Rifampicin, Rifabutin, and Rifapentine Inducers of CYP3A enzymes, such as efavirenz, nevirapine, rifampicin, rifabutin, and rifapentine will increase the metabolism of clarithromycin, thus decreasing plasma concentrations of clarithromycin, while increasing those of 14-OH-clarithromycin. Since the microbiological activities of clarithromycin and 14-OHclarithromycin are different for different bacteria, the intended therapeutic effect could be impaired during concomitant administration of clarithromycin and enzyme inducers. Alternative antibacterial treatment should be considered when treating patients receiving inducers of CYP3A. Sildenafil, Tadalafil, and Vardenafil Each of these phosphodiesterase inhibitors is primarily metabolized by CYP3A, and CYP3A will be inhibited by concomitant administration of clarithromycin. Co-administration of clarithromycin with sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil will result in increased exposure of these phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Coadministration of these phosphodiesterase inhibitors with clarithromycin is not recommended. Tolterodine The primary route of metabolism for tolterodine is via CYP2D6. However, in a subset of the population devoid of CYP2D6, the identified pathway of metabolism is via CYP3A. In this population subset, inhibition of CYP3A results in significantly higher serum concentrations of tolterodine. Tolterodine 1 mg twice daily is recommended in patients deficient in CYP2D6 activity (poor metabolizers) when co-administered with clarithromycin. Triazolobenzodiazepines (e.g., alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam) When a single dose of midazolam was co-administered with clarithromycin tablets (500 mg twice daily for 7 days), midazolam AUC increased 174% after intravenous administration of midazolam and 600% after oral administration. When oral midazolam is co-administered with clarithromycin, dose adjustments may be necessary and possible prolongation and intensity of effect should be anticipated. Caution and appropriate dose adjustments should be considered when triazolam or alprazolam is co-administered with clarithromycin. For benzodiazepines which are not metabolized by CYP3A (e.g., temazepam, nitrazepam, lorazepam), a clinically important interaction with clarithromycin is unlikely. There have been post-marketing reports of drug interactions and central nervous system (CNS) effects (e.g., somnolence and confusion) with the concomitant use of clarithromycin and triazolam. Monitoring the patient for increased CNS pharmacological effects is suggested. Atazanavir Both clarithromycin and atazanavir are substrates and inhibitors of CYP3A, and there is evidence of a bidirectional drug interaction. Following administration of clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) with atazanavir (400 mg once daily), the clarithromycin AUC increased 94%, the 14-OH clarithromycin AUC decreased 70% and the atazanavir AUC increased 28%. When clarithromycin is co-administered with atazanavir, the dose of clarithromycin should be decreased by 50%. Since concentrations of 14-OH clarithromycin are significantly reduced when clarithromycin is co-administered with atazanavir, alternative antibacterial therapy should be considered for indications other than infections due to Mycobacterium avium complex (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Doses of clarithromycin greater than 1000 mg per day should not be co-administered with protease inhibitors. Itraconazole Both clarithromycin and itraconazole are substrates and inhibitors of CYP3A, potentially leading to a bidirectional drug interaction when administered concomitantly. Clarithromycin may increase the plasma concentrations of itraconazole, while itraconazole may increase the plasma concentrations of clarithromycin. Patients taking itraconazole and clarithromycin concomitantly should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged adverse reactions. Saquinavir Both clarithromycin and saquinavir are substrates and inhibitors of CYP3A and there is evidence of a bidirectional drug interaction. Following administration of clarithromycin (500 mg bid) and saquinavir (soft gelatin capsules, 1200 mg tid) to 12 healthy volunteers, the steady-state saquinavir AUC and C max increased 177% and 187% respectively compared to administration of saquinavir alone. Clarithromycin AUC and C max increased 45% and 39% respectively, whereas the 14\u2013OH clarithromycin AUC and C max decreased 24% and 34% respectively, compared to administration with clarithromycin alone. No dose adjustment of clarithromycin is necessary when clarithromycin is co-administered with saquinavir in patients with normal renal function. When saquinavir is co-administered with ritonavir, consideration should be given to the potential effects of ritonavir on clarithromycin (refer to interaction between clarithromycin and ritonavir) (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). The following CYP3A based drug interactions have been observed with erythromycin products and/or with clarithromycin in post-marketing experience: Antiarrhythmics There have been postmarketing reports of torsades de pointes occurring with concurrent use of clarithromycin and quinidine or disopyramide. Electrocardiograms should be monitored for QTc prolongation during coadministration of clarithromycin with these drugs. Serum concentrations of these medications should also be monitored. Ergotamine/Dihydroergotamine Post-marketing reports indicate that coadministration of clarithromycin with ergotamine or dihydroergotamine has been associated with acute ergot toxicity characterized by vasospasm and ischemia of the extremities and other tissues including the central nervous system. Concomitant administration of clarithromycin with ergotamine or dihydroergotamine is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Triazolobenzodiazepines (such as Triazolam and Alprazolam) and Related Benzodiazepines (such as Midazolam) Erythromycin has been reported to decrease the clearance of triazolam and midazolam, and thus, may increase the pharmacologic effect of these benzodiazepines. There have been post-marketing reports of drug interactions and CNS effects (e.g., somnolence and confusion) with the concomitant use of clarithromycin and triazolam. Sildenafil (Viagra) Erythromycin has been reported to increase the systemic exposure (AUC) of sildenafil. A similar interaction may occur with clarithromycin; reduction of sildenafil dosage should be considered. (See Viagra package insert.) There have been spontaneous or published reports of CYP3A based interactions of erythromycin and/or clarithromycin with cyclosporine, carbamazepine, tacrolimus, alfentanil, disopyramide, rifabutin, quinidine, methylprednisolone, cilostazol, bromocriptine and vinblastine. Concomitant administration of clarithromycin with cisapride, pimozide, astemizole, or terfenadine is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). In addition, there have been reports of interactions of erythromycin or clarithromycin with drugs not thought to be metabolized by CYP3A, including hexobarbital, phenytoin, and valproate."

        "Geriatric Use In a steady-state study in which healthy elderly subjects (age 65 to 81 years old) were given 500 mg every 12 hours, the maximum serum concentrations and area under the curves of clarithromycin and 14-OH clarithromycin were increased compared to those achieved in healthy young adults. These changes in pharmacokinetics parallel known age-related decreases in renal function. In clinical trials, elderly patients did not have an increased incidence of adverse events when compared to younger patients. Dosage adjustment should be considered in elderly patients with severe renal impairment. Elderly patients may be more susceptible to development of torsades de pointes arrhythmias than younger patients. (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS .)"

        "PRECAUTIONS General Prescribing clarithromycin tablets in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Clarithromycin is principally excreted via the liver and kidney. Clarithromycin may be administered without dosage adjustment to patients with hepatic impairment and normal renal function. However, in the presence of severe renal impairment with or without coexisting hepatic impairment, decreased dosage or prolonged dosing intervals may be appropriate. Clarithromycin in combination with ranitidine bismuth citrate therapy is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance less than 25 mL/min. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Clarithromycin in combination with ranitidine bismuth citrate should not be used in patients with a history of acute porphyria. Exacerbation of symptoms of myasthenia gravis and new onset of symptoms of myasthenic syndrome has been reported in patients receiving clarithromycin therapy. For information about precautions of other drugs indicated in combination with clarithromycin, refer to the PRECAUTIONS section of their package inserts. Information to Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including clarithromycin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When clarithromycin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by clarithromycin or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Clarithromycin tablets may interact with some drugs; therefore patients should be advised to report to their doctor the use of any other medications. Clarithromycin tablets can be taken with or without food and can be taken with milk. Drug Interactions Clarithromycin use in patients who are receiving theophylline may be associated with an increase of serum theophylline concentrations. Monitoring of serum theophylline concentrations should be considered for patients receiving high doses of theophylline or with baseline concentrations in the upper therapeutic range.

Clarithromycin should be used with caution in patients receiving treatment with other drugs known to be CYP3A enzyme substrates, especially if the CYP3A substrate has a narrow safety margin (e.g., carbamazepine) and/or the substrate is extensively metabolized by this enzyme. Dosage adjustments may be considered, and when possible, serum concentrations of drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A should be monitored closely in patients concurrently receiving clarithromycin. The following are examples of some clinically significant CYP3A based drug interactions. Interactions with other drugs metabolized by the CYP3A isoform are also possible. Carbamazepine and Terfenadine Increased serum concentrations of carbamazepine and the active acid metabolite of terfenadine were observed in clinical trials with clarithromycin. Colchicine Colchicine is a substrate for both CYP3A and the efflux transporter, P-glycoprotein (Pgp). Clarithromycin and other macrolides are known to inhibit CYP3A and Pgp. When a single dose of colchicine 0.6 mg was administered with clarithromycin 250 mg BID for 7 days, the colchicine C max increased 197% and the AUC0-\u221e increased 239% compared to administration of colchicine alone. The dose of colchicine should be reduced when co-administered with clarithromycin in patients with normal renal and hepatic function. Concomitant use of clarithromycin and colchicine is contraindicated in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. (See WARNINGS ). Efavirenz, Nevirapine, Rifampicin, Rifabutin, and Rifapentine Inducers of CYP3A enzymes, such as efavirenz, nevirapine, rifampicin, rifabutin, and rifapentine will increase the metabolism of clarithromycin, thus decreasing plasma concentrations of clarithromycin, while increasing those of 14-OH-clarithromycin. Since the microbiological activities of clarithromycin and 14-OHclarithromycin are different for different bacteria, the intended therapeutic effect could be impaired during concomitant administration of clarithromycin and enzyme inducers. Alternative antibacterial treatment should be considered when treating patients receiving inducers of CYP3A. Sildenafil, Tadalafil, and Vardenafil Each of these phosphodiesterase inhibitors is primarily metabolized by CYP3A, and CYP3A will be inhibited by concomitant administration of clarithromycin. Co-administration of clarithromycin with sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil will result in increased exposure of these phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Coadministration of these phosphodiesterase inhibitors with clarithromycin is not recommended. Tolterodine The primary route of metabolism for tolterodine is via CYP2D6. However, in a subset of the population devoid of CYP2D6, the identified pathway of metabolism is via CYP3A. In this population subset, inhibition of CYP3A results in significantly higher serum concentrations of tolterodine. Tolterodine 1 mg twice daily is recommended in patients deficient in CYP2D6 activity (poor metabolizers) when co-administered with clarithromycin. Triazolobenzodiazepines (e.g., alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam) When a single dose of midazolam was co-administered with clarithromycin tablets (500 mg twice daily for 7 days), midazolam AUC increased 174% after intravenous administration of midazolam and 600% after oral administration. When oral midazolam is co-administered with clarithromycin, dose adjustments may be necessary and possible prolongation and intensity of effect should be anticipated. Caution and appropriate dose adjustments should be considered when triazolam or alprazolam is co-administered with clarithromycin. For benzodiazepines which are not metabolized by CYP3A (e.g., temazepam, nitrazepam, lorazepam), a clinically important interaction with clarithromycin is unlikely. There have been post-marketing reports of drug interactions and central nervous system (CNS) effects (e.g., somnolence and confusion) with the concomitant use of clarithromycin and triazolam. Monitoring the patient for increased CNS pharmacological effects is suggested. Atazanavir Both clarithromycin and atazanavir are substrates and inhibitors of CYP3A, and there is evidence of a bidirectional drug interaction. Following administration of clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) with atazanavir (400 mg once daily), the clarithromycin AUC increased 94%, the 14-OH clarithromycin AUC decreased 70% and the atazanavir AUC increased 28%. When clarithromycin is co-administered with atazanavir, the dose of clarithromycin should be decreased by 50%. Since concentrations of 14-OH clarithromycin are significantly reduced when clarithromycin is co-administered with atazanavir, alternative antibacterial therapy should be considered for indications other than infections due to Mycobacterium avium complex (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Doses of clarithromycin greater than 1000 mg per day should not be co-administered with protease inhibitors. Itraconazole Both clarithromycin and itraconazole are substrates and inhibitors of CYP3A, potentially leading to a bidirectional drug interaction when administered concomitantly. Clarithromycin may increase the plasma concentrations of itraconazole, while itraconazole may increase the plasma concentrations of clarithromycin. Patients taking itraconazole and clarithromycin concomitantly should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged adverse reactions. Saquinavir Both clarithromycin and saquinavir are substrates and inhibitors of CYP3A and there is evidence of a bidirectional drug interaction. Following administration of clarithromycin (500 mg bid) and saquinavir (soft gelatin capsules, 1200 mg tid) to 12 healthy volunteers, the steady-state saquinavir AUC and C max increased 177% and 187% respectively compared to administration of saquinavir alone. Clarithromycin AUC and C max increased 45% and 39% respectively, whereas the 14\u2013OH clarithromycin AUC and C max decreased 24% and 34% respectively, compared to administration with clarithromycin alone. No dose adjustment of clarithromycin is necessary when clarithromycin is co-administered with saquinavir in patients with normal renal function. When saquinavir is co-administered with ritonavir, consideration should be given to the potential effects of ritonavir on clarithromycin (refer to interaction between clarithromycin and ritonavir) (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). The following CYP3A based drug interactions have been observed with erythromycin products and/or with clarithromycin in post-marketing experience: Antiarrhythmics There have been postmarketing reports of torsades de pointes occurring with concurrent use of clarithromycin and quinidine or disopyramide. Electrocardiograms should be monitored for QTc prolongation during coadministration of clarithromycin with these drugs. Serum concentrations of these medications should also be monitored. Ergotamine/Dihydroergotamine Post-marketing reports indicate that coadministration of clarithromycin with ergotamine or dihydroergotamine has been associated with acute ergot toxicity characterized by vasospasm and ischemia of the extremities and other tissues including the central nervous system. Concomitant administration of clarithromycin with ergotamine or dihydroergotamine is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Triazolobenzodiazepines (such as Triazolam and Alprazolam) and Related Benzodiazepines (such as Midazolam) Erythromycin has been reported to decrease the clearance of triazolam and midazolam, and thus, may increase the pharmacologic effect of these benzodiazepines. There have been post-marketing reports of drug interactions and CNS effects (e.g., somnolence and confusion) with the concomitant use of clarithromycin and triazolam. Sildenafil (Viagra) Erythromycin has been reported to increase the systemic exposure (AUC) of sildenafil. A similar interaction may occur with clarithromycin; reduction of sildenafil dosage should be considered. (See Viagra package insert.) There have been spontaneous or published reports of CYP3A based interactions of erythromycin and/or clarithromycin with cyclosporine, carbamazepine, tacrolimus, alfentanil, disopyramide, rifabutin, quinidine, methylprednisolone, cilostazol, bromocriptine and vinblastine. Concomitant administration of clarithromycin with cisapride, pimozide, astemizole, or terfenadine is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). In addition, there have been reports of interactions of erythromycin or clarithromycin with drugs not thought to be metabolized by CYP3A, including hexobarbital, phenytoin, and valproate. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The following in vitro mutagenicity tests have been conducted with clarithromycin: Salmonella /Mammalian Microsomes Test Bacterial Induced Mutation Frequency Test In Vitro Chromosome Aberration Test Rat Hepatocyte DNA Synthesis Assay Mouse Lymphoma Assay Mouse Dominant Lethal Study Mouse Micronucleus Test All tests had negative results except the In Vitro Chromosome Aberration Test which was weakly positive in one test and negative in another. In addition, a Bacterial Reverse-Mutation Test (Ames Test) has been performed on clarithromycin metabolites with negative results. Fertility and reproduction studies have shown that daily doses of up to 160 mg/kg/day (1.3 times the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m 2 ) to male and female rats caused no adverse effects on the estrous cycle, fertility, parturition, or number and viability of offspring. Plasma levels in rats after 150 mg/kg/day were 2 times the human serum levels. In the 150 mg/kg/day monkey studies, plasma levels were 3 times the human serum levels. When given orally at 150 mg/kg/day (2.4 times the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m 2 ), clarithromycin was shown to produce embryonic loss in monkeys. This effect has been attributed to marked maternal toxicity of the drug at this high dose. In rabbits, in utero fetal loss occurred at an intravenous dose of 33 mg/m 2 , which is 17 times less than the maximum proposed human oral daily dose of 618 mg/m 2 . Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of clarithromycin. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C Four teratogenicity studies in rats (three with oral doses and one with intravenous doses up to 160 mg/kg/day administered during the period of major organogenesis) and two in rabbits at oral doses up to 125 mg/kg/day (approximately 2 times the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m 2 ) or intravenous doses of 30 mg/kg/day administered during gestation days 6 to 18 failed to demonstrate any teratogenicity from clarithromycin. Two additional oral studies in a different rat strain at similar doses and similar conditions demonstrated a low incidence of cardiovascular anomalies at doses of 150 mg/kg/day administered during gestation days 6 to 15. Plasma levels after 150 mg/kg/day were 2 times the human serum levels. Four studies in mice revealed a variable incidence of cleft palate following oral doses of 1000 mg/kg/day (2 and 4 times the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m 2 , respectively) during gestation days 6 to 15. Cleft palate was also seen at 500 mg/kg/day. The 1000 mg/kg/day exposure resulted in plasma levels 17 times the human serum levels. In monkeys, an oral dose of 70 mg/kg/day (an approximate equidose of the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m 2 ) produced fetal growth retardation at plasma levels that were 2 times the human serum levels. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Clarithromycin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. (See WARNINGS .) Nursing Mothers It is not known whether clarithromycin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when clarithromycin is administered to a nursing woman. It is known that clarithromycin is excreted in the milk of lactating animals and that other drugs of this class are excreted in human milk. Preweaned rats, exposed indirectly via consumption of milk from dams treated with 150 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks, were not adversely affected, despite data indicating higher drug levels in milk than in plasma. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of clarithromycin in pediatric patients under 6 months of age have not been established. The safety of clarithromycin has not been studied in MAC patients under the age of 20 months. Neonatal and juvenile animals tolerated clarithromycin in a manner similar to adult animals. Young animals were slightly more intolerant to acute overdosage and to subtle reductions in erythrocytes, platelets and leukocytes but were less sensitive to toxicity in the liver, kidney, thymus, and genitalia. Geriatric Use In a steady-state study in which healthy elderly subjects (age 65 to 81 years old) were given 500 mg every 12 hours, the maximum serum concentrations and area under the curves of clarithromycin and 14-OH clarithromycin were increased compared to those achieved in healthy young adults. These changes in pharmacokinetics parallel known age-related decreases in renal function. In clinical trials, elderly patients did not have an increased incidence of adverse events when compared to younger patients. Dosage adjustment should be considered in elderly patients with severe renal impairment. Elderly patients may be more susceptible to development of torsades de pointes arrhythmias than younger patients. (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS .)"

        "General Prescribing clarithromycin tablets in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Clarithromycin is principally excreted via the liver and kidney. Clarithromycin may be administered without dosage adjustment to patients with hepatic impairment and normal renal function. However, in the presence of severe renal impairment with or without coexisting hepatic impairment, decreased dosage or prolonged dosing intervals may be appropriate. Clarithromycin in combination with ranitidine bismuth citrate therapy is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance less than 25 mL/min. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Clarithromycin in combination with ranitidine bismuth citrate should not be used in patients with a history of acute porphyria. Exacerbation of symptoms of myasthenia gravis and new onset of symptoms of myasthenic syndrome has been reported in patients receiving clarithromycin therapy. For information about precautions of other drugs indicated in combination with clarithromycin, refer to the PRECAUTIONS section of their package inserts."

        "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Clarithromycin tablets are indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible isolates of the designated bacteria in the conditions as listed below: Adults Pharyngitis/Tonsillitis due to Streptococcus pyogenes (The usual drug of choice in the treatment and prevention of streptococcal infections and the prophylaxis of rheumatic fever is penicillin administered by either the intramuscular or the oral route. Clarithromycin is generally effective in the eradication of S. pyogenes from the nasopharynx; however, data establishing the efficacy of clarithromycin in the subsequent prevention of rheumatic fever are not available at present.) Acute maxillary sinusitis due to Haemophilusinfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis , or Streptococcus pneumoniae Acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis due to Haemophilusinfluenzae, Haemophilusparainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, or Streptococcus pneumoniae Community-Acquired Pneumonia due to Haemophilusinfluenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Chlamydia pneumoniae (TWAR) Uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections due to Staphylococcus aureus, or Streptococcus pyogenes (Abscesses usually require surgical drainage.) Disseminated mycobacterial infections due to Mycobacterium avium, or Mycobacterium intracellulare Clarithromycin tablets in combination with amoxicillin and lansoprazole or omeprazole delayed-release capsules, as triple therapy, are indicated for the treatment of patients with H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer disease (active or five-year history of duodenal ulcer) to eradicate H. pylori. Clarithromycin tablets in combination with omeprazole capsules or ranitidine bismuth citrate tablets are also indicated for the treatment of patients with an active duodenal ulcer associated with H. pylori infection. However, regimens which contain clarithromycin as the single antimicrobial agent are more likely to be associated with the development of clarithromycin resistance among patients who fail therapy. Clarithromycin-containing regimens should not be used in patients with known or suspected clarithromycin resistant isolates because the efficacy of treatment is reduced in this setting. In patients who fail therapy, susceptibility testing should be done if possible. If resistance to clarithromycin is demonstrated, a non-clarithromycin-containing therapy is recommended. (For information on development of resistance see Microbiology section.) The eradication of H. pylori has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence. Children Pharyngitis/Tonsillitis due to Streptococcus pyogenes Community-Acquired Pneumonia due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Chlamydia pneumoniae (TWAR) Acute maxillary sinusitis due to Haemophilusinfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, or Streptococcus pneumoniae Acute otitis media due to Haemophilusinfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis ,or Streptococcus pneumoniae NOTE: For information on otitis media, see CLINICAL STUDIES: Otitis Media . Uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections due to Staphylococcus aureus, or Streptococcus pyogenes (Abscesses usually require surgical drainage.) Disseminated mycobacterial infections due to Mycobacterium avium, or Mycobacterium intracellulare Prophylaxis Clarithromycin tablets are indicated for the prevention of disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease in patients with advanced HIV infection. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of clarithromycin tablets and other antibacterial drugs, clarithromycin tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

        "Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C Four teratogenicity studies in rats (three with oral doses and one with intravenous doses up to 160 mg/kg/day administered during the period of major organogenesis) and two in rabbits at oral doses up to 125 mg/kg/day (approximately 2 times the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m 2 ) or intravenous doses of 30 mg/kg/day administered during gestation days 6 to 18 failed to demonstrate any teratogenicity from clarithromycin. Two additional oral studies in a different rat strain at similar doses and similar conditions demonstrated a low incidence of cardiovascular anomalies at doses of 150 mg/kg/day administered during gestation days 6 to 15. Plasma levels after 150 mg/kg/day were 2 times the human serum levels. Four studies in mice revealed a variable incidence of cleft palate following oral doses of 1000 mg/kg/day (2 and 4 times the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m 2 , respectively) during gestation days 6 to 15. Cleft palate was also seen at 500 mg/kg/day. The 1000 mg/kg/day exposure resulted in plasma levels 17 times the human serum levels. In monkeys, an oral dose of 70 mg/kg/day (an approximate equidose of the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m 2 ) produced fetal growth retardation at plasma levels that were 2 times the human serum levels. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Clarithromycin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

      "contraindications": [
        "CONTRAINDICATIONS Clarithromycin is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to clarithromycin or any of its excipients, erythromycin, or any of the macrolide antibiotics. Clarithromycin is contraindicated in patients with a history of cholestatic jaundice/hepatic dysfunction associated with prior use of clarithromycin. Concomitant administration of clarithromycin and any of the following drugs is contraindicated: cisapride, pimozide, astemizole, terfenadine, and ergotamine or dihydroergotamine (see Drug Interactions ). There have been post-marketing reports of drug interactions when clarithromycin and/or erythromycin are co-administered with cisapride, pimozide, astemizole, or terfenadine resulting in cardiac arrhythmias (QT prolongation, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and torsades de pointes) most likely due to inhibition of metabolism of these drugs by erythromycin and clarithromycin. Fatalities have been reported. Concomitant administration of clarithromycin and colchicine is contraindicated in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Clarithromycin should not be given to patients with history of QT prolongation or ventricular cardiac arrhythmia, including torsades de pointes . Clarithromycin should not be used concomitantly with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) that are extensively metabolized by CYP3A4 (lovastatin or simvastatin), due to the increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis. (see WARNINGS ). For information about contraindications of other drugs indicated in combination with clarithromycin, refer to the CONTRAINDICATIONS section of their package inserts."

        "WARNINGS Use In Pregnancy CLARITHROMYCIN SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PREGNANT WOMEN EXCEPT IN CLINICAL CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE NO ALTERNATIVE THERAPY IS APPROPRIATE. IF PREGNANCY OCCURS WHILE TAKING THIS DRUG, THE PATIENT SHOULD BE APPRISED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARD TO THE FETUS. CLARITHROMYCIN HAS DEMONSTRATED ADVERSE EFFECTS OF PREGNANCY OUTCOME AND/OR EMBRYO-FETAL DEVELOPMENT IN MONKEYS, RATS, MICE, AND RABBITS AT DOSES THAT PRODUCED PLASMA LEVELS 2 TO 17 TIMES THE SERUM LEVELS ACHIEVED IN HUMANS TREATED AT THE MAXIMUM RECOMMENDED HUMAN DOSES. (See PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy .) Hepatotoxicity Hepatic dysfunction, including increased liver enzymes, and hepatocellular and/or cholestatic hepatitis, with or without jaundice, has been reported with clarithromycin. This hepatic dysfunction may be severe and is usually reversible. In some instances, hepatic failure with fatal outcome has been reported and generally has been associated with serious underlying diseases and/or concomitant medications. Discontinue clarithromycin immediately if signs and symptoms of hepatitis occur. QT Prolongation Clarithromycin has been associated with prolongation of the QT interval and infrequent cases of arrhythmia. Cases of torsades de pointes have been spontaneously reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients receiving clarithromycin. Fatalities have been reported. Clarithromycin should be avoided in patients with ongoing proarrhythmic conditions such as uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, clinically significant bradycardia (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ) and in patients receiving Class IA (quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (dofetilide, amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents. Elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval. Drug Interactions Serious adverse reactions have been reported in patients taking clarithromycin concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates. These include colchicine toxicity with colchicine; rhabdomyolysis with simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin; and hypotension with calcium channel blockers metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., verapamil, amlodipine, diltiazem) (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Life-threatening and fatal drug interactions have been reported in patients treated with clarithromycin and colchicine. Clarithromycin is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and this interaction may occur while using both drugs at their recommended doses. If co-administration of clarithromycin and colchicine is necessary in patients with normal renal and hepatic function, the dose of colchicine should be reduced. Patients should be monitored for clinical symptoms of colchicine toxicity. Concomitant administration of clarithromycin and colchicine is contraindicated in patients with renal or hepatic impairment (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including clarithromycin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. For information about warnings of other drugs indicated in combination with clarithromycin, refer to the WARNINGS section of their package inserts. Acute Hypersensitivity Reactions In the event of severe acute hypersensitivity reactions, such as anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and Henoch-Schonlein purpura clarithromycin therapy should be discontinued immediately and appropriate treatment should be urgently initiated. Oral Hypoglycemic Agents/Insulin The concomitant use of clarithromycin and oral hypoglycemic agents and/or insulin can result in significant hypoglycemia. With certain hypoglycemic drugs such as nateglinide, pioglitazone, repaglinide and rosiglitazone, inhibition of CYP3A enzyme by clarithromycin may be involved and could cause hypolgycemia when used concomitantly. Careful monitoring of glucose is recommended. Oral Anticoagulants There is a risk of serious hemorrhage and significant elevations in INR and prothrombin time when clarithromycin is co-administered with warfarin. INR and prothrombin times should be frequently monitored while patients are receiving clarithromycin and oral anticoagulants concurrently. HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors (statins) Concomitant use of clarithromycin with lovastatin or simvastatin is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ) as these statins are extensively metabolized by CYP3A4, and concomitant treatment with clarithromycin increases their plasma concentration, which increases the risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis. Cases of rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients taking clarithromycin concomitantly with these statins. If treatment with clarithromycin cannot be avoided, therapy with lovastatin or simvastatin must be suspended during the course of treatment. Caution should be exercised when prescribing clarithromycin with statins. In situations where the concomitant use of clarithromycin with atorvastatin or pravastatin cannot be avoided, atorvastatin dose should not exceed 20 mg daily and pravastatin dose should not exceed 40 mg daily. Use of a statin that is not dependent on CYP3A metabolism (e.g.fluvastatin) can be considered. It is recommended to prescribe the lowest registered dose if concomitant use cannot be avoided."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The majority of side effects observed in clinical trials were of a mild and transient nature. Fewer than 3% of adult patients without mycobacterial infections and fewer than 2% of pediatric patients without mycobacterial infections discontinued therapy because of drug-related side effects. The most frequently reported events in adults taking clarithromycin tablets, USP were diarrhea (3%), nausea (3%), abnormal taste (3%), dyspepsia (2%), abdominal pain/discomfort (2%), and headache (2%). In pediatric patients, the most frequently reported events were diarrhea (6%), vomiting (6%), abdominal pain (3%), rash (3%), and headache (2%). Most of these events were described as mild or moderate in severity. Of the reported adverse events, only 1% was described as severe. In the acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and acute maxillary sinusitis studies overall gastrointestinal adverse events were reported by a similar proportion of patients taking either clarithromycin tablets or clarithromycin extended-release tablets; however, patients taking clarithromycin extended-release tablets reported significantly less severe gastrointestinal symptoms compared to patients taking clarithromycin tablets. In addition, patients taking clarithromycin extended-release tablets had significantly fewer premature discontinuations for drug-related gastrointestinal or abnormal taste adverse events compared to clarithromycin tablets. In community-acquired pneumonia studies conducted in adults comparing clarithromycin to erythromycin base or erythromycin stearate, there were fewer adverse events involving the digestive system in clarithromycin-treated patients compared to erythromycin-treated patients (13% vs 32%; p<0.01). Twenty percent of erythromycin-treated patients discontinued therapy due to adverse events compared to 4% of clarithromycin-treated patients. In two U.S. studies of acute otitis media comparing clarithromycin to amoxicillin/potassium clavulanate in pediatric patients, there were fewer adverse events involving the digestive system in clarithromycin-treated patients compared to amoxicillin/potassium clavulanate-treated patients (21% vs 40%, p<0.001). One-third as many clarithromycin-treated patients reported diarrhea as did amoxicillin/potassium clavulanate-treated patients. Post-Marketing Experience Allergic reactions ranging from urticaria and mild skin eruptions to rare cases of anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), Henoch-Schonlein Purpura and toxic epidermal necrolysis have occurred. Other spontaneously reported adverse events include glossitis, stomatitis, oral moniliasis, anorexia, vomiting, pancreatitis, tongue discoloration, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, dizziness, myalgia and hemorrhage. There have been reports of tooth discoloration in patients treated with clarithromycin. Tooth discoloration is usually reversible with professional dental cleaning. There have been isolated reports of hearing loss, which is usually reversible, occurring chiefly in elderly women. Reports of alterations of the sense of smell including smell loss, usually in conjunction with taste perversion or taste loss, have also been reported. Transient CNS events including anxiety, behavioral changes, confusional states, convulsions, depersonalization, disorientation, hallucinations, insomnia, depression, manic behavior, nightmares, psychosis, tinnitus, tremor, and vertigo have been reported during post-marketing surveillance. Events usually resolve with discontinuation of the drug. Adverse reactions related to hepatic dysfunction have been reported in postmarketing experience with clarithromycin. (See WARNINGS: Hepatotoxicity .) There have been rare reports of hypoglycemia, some of which have occurred in patients taking oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin. There have been post-marketing reports of clarithromycin tablets in the stool, many of which have occurred in patients with anatomic (including ileostomy or colostomy) or functional gastrointestinal disorders with shortened GI transit times. As with other macrolides, clarithromycin has been associated with QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and torsades de pointes. There have been reports of interstitial nephritis coincident with clarithromycin use. There have been post-marketing reports of colchicine toxicity with concomitant use of clarithromycin and colchicine, especially in the elderly, some of which occurred in patients with renal insufficiency. Deaths have been reported in some such patients. (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS .) There have been cases of rhabdomyolysis reported with clarithromycin use. In some cases, clarithromycin was administered concomitantly with other drugs known to be associated with rhabdomyolysis (such as statins, fibrates, colchicine or allopurinol). Changes in Laboratory Values Changes in laboratory values with possible clinical significance were as follows: Hepatic \u2013 elevated SGPT (ALT) <1%; SGOT (AST) <1%; GGT <1%; alkaline phosphatase <1%; LDH <1%; total bilirubin <1% Hematologic \u2013 decreased WBC <1%; elevated prothrombin time 1% Renal \u2013 elevated BUN 4%; elevated serum creatinine <1% GGT, alkaline phosphatase, and prothrombin time data are from adult studies only."

        "ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY AND TOXICOLOGY Clarithromycin is rapidly and well-absorbed with dose-linear kinetics, low protein binding, and a high volume of distribution. Plasma half-life ranged from 1 to 6 hours and was species dependent. High tissue concentrations were achieved, but negligible accumulation was observed. Fecal clearance predominated. Hepatotoxicity occurred in all species tested (i.e., in rats and monkeys at doses 2 times greater than and in dogs at doses comparable to the maximum human daily dose, based on mg/m 2 ). Renal tubular degeneration (calculated on a mg/m 2 basis) occurred in rats at doses 2 times, in monkeys at doses 8 times, and in dogs at doses 12 times greater than the maximum human daily dose. Testicular atrophy (on a mg/m 2 basis) occurred in rats at doses 7 times, in dogs at doses 3 times, and in monkeys at doses 8 times greater than the maximum human daily dose. Corneal opacity (on a mg/m 2 basis) occurred in dogs at doses 12 times and in monkeys at doses 8 times greater than the maximum human daily dose. Lymphoid depletion (on a mg/m 2 basis) occurred in dogs at doses 3 times greater than and in monkeys at doses 2 times greater than the maximum human daily dose. These adverse events were absent during clinical trials."

      "information_for_patients": [
        "Information to Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including clarithromycin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When clarithromycin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by clarithromycin or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Clarithromycin tablets may interact with some drugs; therefore patients should be advised to report to their doctor the use of any other medications. Clarithromycin tablets can be taken with or without food and can be taken with milk."

        "CLINICAL STUDIES Mycobacterial Infections Prophylaxis A randomized, double-blind study (561) compared clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d. to placebo in patients with CDC-defined AIDS and CD 4 counts <100 cells/\u00b5L. This study accrued 682 patients from November 1992 to January 1994, with a median CD 4 cell count at study entry of 30 cells/\u00b5L. Median duration of clarithromycin was 10.6 months vs. 8.2 months for placebo. More patients in the placebo arm than the clarithromycin arm discontinued prematurely from the study (75.6% and 67.4%, respectively). However, if premature discontinuations due to MAC or death are excluded, approximately equal percentages of patients on each arm (54.8% on clarithromycin and 52.5% on placebo) discontinued study drug early for other reasons. The study was designed to evaluate the following endpoints: MAC bacteremia, defined as at least one positive culture for M. avium complex bacteria from blood or another normally sterile site. Survival Clinically significant disseminated MAC disease, defined as MAC bacteremia accompanied by signs or symptoms of serious MAC infection, including fever, night sweats, weight loss, anemia, or elevations in liver function tests. MAC Bacteremia In patients randomized to clarithromycin, the risk of MAC bacteremia was reduced by 69% compared to placebo. The difference between groups was statistically significant (p<0.001). On an intent-to-treat basis, the one-year cumulative incidence of MAC bacteremia was 5.0% for patients randomized to clarithromycin and 19.4% for patients randomized to placebo. While only 19 of the 341 patients randomized to clarithromycin developed MAC, 11 of these cases were resistant to clarithromycin. The patients with resistant MAC bacteremia had a median baseline CD 4 count of 10 cells/mm 3 (range 2 to 25 cells/mm 3 ). Information regarding the clinical course and response to treatment of the patients with resistant MAC bacteremia is limited. The 8 patients who received clarithromycin and developed susceptible MAC bacteremia had a median baseline CD 4 count of 25 cells/mm 3 (range 10 to 80 cells/mm 3 ). Comparatively, 53 of the 341 placebo patients developed MAC; none of these isolates were resistant to clarithromycin. The median baseline CD 4 count was 15 cells/mm 3 (range 2 to 130 cells/mm 3 ) for placebo patients that developed MAC. Survival A statistically significant survival benefit was observed. Survival All Randomized Patients Survival All Randomized Patients Mortality Reduction in Mortality on Clarithromycin Placebo Clarithromycin 6 month 9.4% 6.5% 31% 12 month 29.7% 20.5% 31% 18 month 46.4% 37.5% 20% Since the analysis at 18 months includes patients no longer receiving prophylaxis the survival benefit of clarithromycin may be underestimated. Survival All Randomized Patients Graph Clinically Significant Disseminated MAC Disease In association with the decreased incidence of bacteremia, patients in the group randomized to clarithromycin showed reductions in the signs and symptoms of disseminated MAC disease, including fever, night sweats, weight loss, and anemia. Safety In AIDS patients treated with clarithromycin over long periods of time for prophylaxis against M. avium, it was often difficult to distinguish adverse events possibly associated with clarithromycin administration from underlying HIV disease or intercurrent illness. Median duration of treatment was 10.6 months for the clarithromycin group and 8.2 months for the placebo group. Treatment-related Includes those events possibly or probably related to study drug and excludes concurrent conditions. Adverse Event Incidence Rates (%) in Immunocompromised Adult Patients Receiving Prophylaxis Against M. avium Complex Body System >2% Adverse Event Incidence Rates for either treatment group.

Discontinuation due to adverse events was required in 18% of patients receiving clarithromycin compared to 17% of patients receiving placebo in this trial. Primary reasons for discontinuation in clarithromycin treated patients include headache, nausea, vomiting, depression and taste perversion. Changes in Laboratory Values of Potential Clinical Importance In immuno-compromised patients receiving prophylaxis against M. avium, evaluations of laboratory values were made by analyzing those values outside the seriously abnormal value (i.e., the extreme high or low limit) for the specified test.

These studies accrued patients from May 1991 to March 1992. Study 500 was randomized, double-blind; Study 577 was open-label compassionate use. Both studies used 500 and 1000 mg b.i.d. doses; Study 500 also had a 2000 mg b.i.d. group. Study 521 was a pediatric study at 3.75, 7.5, and 15 mg/kg b.i.d. Study 500 enrolled 154 adult patients, Study 577 enrolled 469 adult patients, and Study 521 enrolled 25 patients between the ages of 1 to 20. The majority of patients had CD 4 cell counts <50/mcL at study entry. The studies were designed to evaluate the following end points: Change in MAC bacteremia or blood cultures negative for M. avium. Change in clinical signs and symptoms of MAC infection including one or more of the following: fever, night sweats, weight loss, diarrhea, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly. The results for the 500 study are described below. The 577 study results were similar to the results of the 500 study. Results with the 7.5 mg/kg b.i.d. dose in the pediatric study were comparable to those for the 500 mg b.i.d. regimen in the adult studies. Study 069 compared the safety and efficacy of clarithromycin in combination with ethambutol versus clarithromycin in combination with ethambutol and clofazimine for the treatment of disseminated MAC (dMAC) infection 5 . This 24-week study enrolled 106 patients with AIDS and dMAC, with 55 patients randomized to receive clarithromycin and ethambutol, and 51 patients randomized to receive clarithromycin, ethambutol, and clofazimine. Baseline characteristics between study arms were similar with the exception of median CFU counts being at least 1 log higher in the clarithromycin, ethambutol, and clofazimine arm. Compared to prior experience with clarithromycin monotherapy, the two-drug regimen of clarithromycin and ethambutol was well tolerated and extended the time to microbiologic relapse, largely through suppressing the emergence of clarithromycin resistant strains. However, the addition of clofazimine to the regimen added no additional microbiologic or clinical benefit. Tolerability of both multidrug regimens was comparable with the most common adverse events being gastrointestinal in nature. Patients receiving the clofazimine-containing regimen had reduced survival rates; however, their baseline mycobacterial colony counts were higher. The results of this trial support the addition of ethambutol to clarithromycin for the treatment of initial dMAC infections but do not support adding clofazimine as a third agent. MAC Bacteremia Decreases in MAC bacteremia or negative blood cultures were seen in the majority of patients in all dose groups. Mean reductions in colony forming units (CFU) are shown below. Included in the table are results from a separate study with a four drug regimen 6 (ciprofloxacin, ethambutol, rifampicin, and clofazimine). Since patient populations and study procedures may vary between these two studies, comparisons between the clarithromycin results and the combination therapy results should be interpreted cautiously. Mean Reductions in Log CFU from Baseline (After 4 Weeks of Therapy) 500 mg b.i.d. (N=35) 1000 mg b.i.d. (N=32) 2000 mg b.i.d. (N=26) Four Drug Regimen (N=24) 1.5 2.3 2.3 1.4 Although the 1000 mg and 2000 mg b.i.d. doses showed significantly better control of bacteremia during the first four weeks of therapy, no significant differences were seen beyond that point. The percent of patients whose blood was sterilized as shown by one or more negative cultures at any time during acute therapy was 61% (30/49) for the 500 mg b.i.d. group and 59% (29/49) and 52% (25/48) for the 1000 and 2000 mg b.i.d. groups, respectively. The percent of patients who had 2 or more negative cultures during acute therapy that were sustained through study Day 84 was 25% (12/49) in both the 500 and 1000 mg b.i.d. groups and 8% (4/48) for the 2000 mg b.i.d. group. By Day 84, 23% (11/49), 37% (18/49), and 56% (27/48) of patients had died or discontinued from the study, and 14% (7/49), 12% (6/49), and 13% (6/48) of patients had relapsed in the 500, 1000, and 2000 mg b.i.d. dose groups, respectively. All of the isolates had an MIC <8 mcg/mL at pre-treatment. Relapse was almost always accompanied by an increase in MIC. The median time to first negative culture was 54, 41, and 29 days for the 500, 1000, and 2000 mg b.i.d. groups, respectively. The time to first decrease of at least 1 log in CFU count was significantly shorter with the 1000 and 2000 mg b.i.d. doses (median equal to 16 and 15 days, respectively) in comparison to the 500 mg b.i.d. group (median equal to 29 days). The median time to first positive culture or study discontinuation following the first negative culture was 43, 59 and 43 days for the 500, 1000, and 2000 mg b.i.d. groups, respectively. Clinically Significant Disseminated MAC Disease Among patients experiencing night sweats prior to therapy, 84% showed resolution or improvement at some point during the 12 weeks of clarithromycin at 500 to 2000 mg b.i.d. doses. Similarly, 77% of patients reported resolution or improvement in fevers at some point. Response rates for clinical signs of MAC are given below: Resolution of Fever Resolution of Night Sweats b.i.d. dose (mg) % ever afebrile % afebrile \u2265 6 weeks b.i.d. dose (mg) % ever resolving % resolving \u2265 6 weeks 500 67% 23% 500 85% 42% 1000 67% 12% 1000 70% 33% 2000 62% 22% 2000 72% 36% Weight Gain > 3% Hemoglobin Increase > 1 gm b.i.d. dose (mg) % ever gaining % gaining \u2265 6 weeks b.i.d. dose (mg) % ever increasing % increasing \u2265 6 weeks 500 33% 14% 500 58% 26% 1000 26% 17% 1000 37% 6% 2000 26% 12% 2000 62% 18% The median duration of response, defined as improvement or resolution of clinical signs and symptoms, was 2 to 6 weeks. Since the study was not designed to determine the benefit of monotherapy beyond 12 weeks, the duration of response may be underestimated for the 25 to 33% of patients who continued to show clinical response after 12 weeks. Survival Median survival time from study entry (Study 500) was 249 days at the 500 mg b.i.d. dose compared to 215 days with the 1000 mg b.i.d. dose. However, during the first 12 weeks of therapy, there were 2 deaths in 53 patients in the 500 mg b.i.d. group versus 13 deaths in 51 patients in the 1000 mg b.i.d. group. The reason for this apparent mortality difference is not known. Survival in the two groups was similar beyond 12 weeks. The median survival times for these dosages were similar to recent historical controls with MAC when treated with combination therapies. 5 Median survival time from study entry in Study 577 was 199 days for the 500 mg b.i.d. dose and 179 days for the 1000 mg b.i.d. dose. During the first four weeks of therapy, while patients were maintained on their originally assigned dose, there were 11 deaths in 255 patients taking 500 mg b.i.d. and 18 deaths in 214 patients taking 1000 mg b.i.d. Safety The adverse event profiles showed that both the 500 and 1000 mg b.i.d. doses were well tolerated. The 2000 mg b.i.d. dose was poorly tolerated and resulted in a higher proportion of premature discontinuations. In AIDS patients and other immunocompromised patients treated with the higher doses of clarithromycin over long periods of time for mycobacterial infections, it was often difficult to distinguish adverse events possibly associated with clarithromycin administration from underlying signs of HIV disease or intercurrent illness. The following analyses summarize experience during the first 12 weeks of therapy with clarithromycin. Data are reported separately for Study 500 (randomized, double-blind) and Study 577 (open-label, compassionate use) and also combined. Adverse events were reported less frequently in Study 577, which may be due in part to differences in monitoring between the two studies. In adult patients receiving clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d., the most frequently reported adverse events, considered possibly or probably related to study drug, with an incidence of 5% or greater, are listed below. Most of these events were mild to moderate in severity, although 5% (Study 500: 8%; Study 577: 4%) of patients receiving 500 mg b.i.d. and 5% (Study 500: 4%; Study 577: 6%) of patients receiving 1000 mg b.i.d. reported severe adverse events. Excluding those patients who discontinued therapy or died due to complications of their underlying non-mycobacterial disease, approximately 8% (Study 500: 15%; Study 577: 7%) of the patients who received 500 mg b.i.d. and 12% (Study 500: 14%; Study 577: 12%) of the patients who received 1000 mg b.i.d. discontinued therapy due to drug-related events during the first 12 weeks of therapy. Overall, the 500 and 1000 mg b.i.d. doses had similar adverse event profiles. Treatment-related Includes those events possibly or probably related to study drug and excludes concurrent conditions.

In this study, very strict evaluability criteria were used to determine clinical response. For the 223 patients who were evaluated for clinical efficacy, the clinical success rate (i.e., cure plus improvement) at the post-therapy visit was 88% for clarithromycin and 91% for the cephalosporin. In a smaller number of patients, microbiologic determinations were made at the pre-treatment visit. The following presumptive bacterial eradication/clinical cure outcomes (i.e., clinical success) were obtained: U.S. Acute Otitis Media Study Clarithromycin vs. Oral Cephalosporin Efficacy Results Pathogen Outcome S. pneumoniae clarithromycin success rate, 13/15 (87%), control 4/5 H. influenzae None of the H. influenzae isolated pre-treatment was resistant to clarithromycin; 6% were resistant to the control agent. clarithromycin success rate, 10/14 (71%), control \u00be M. catarrhalis clarithromycin success rate, 4/5, control 1/1 S. pyogenes clarithromycin success rate, 3/3, control 0/1 Overall clarithromycin success rate, 30/37 (81%), control 8/11 (73%) Safety The incidence of adverse events in all patients treated, primarily diarrhea and vomiting, did not differ clinically or statistically for the two agents. In two other controlled clinical trials of acute otitis media performed in the United States, where significant rates of beta-lactamase producing organisms were found, clarithromycin was compared to an oral antimicrobial agent that contained a specific beta-lactamase inhibitor. In these studies, very strict evaluability criteria were used to determine the clinical responses. In the 233 patients who were evaluated for clinical efficacy, the combined clinical success rate (i.e., cure and improvement) at the post-therapy visit was 91% for both clarithromycin and the control. For the patients who had microbiologic determinations at the pre-treatment visit, the following presumptive bacterial eradication/clinical cure outcomes (i.e., clinical success) were obtained: Two U.S. Acute Otitis Media Studies Clarithromycin vs. Antimicrobial/Beta-lactamase Inhibitor Efficacy Results Pathogen Outcome S. pneumoniae clarithromycin success rate, 43/51 (84%), control 55/56 (98%) H. influenzae Of the H. influenzae isolated pre-treatment, 3% were resistant to clarithromycin and 10% were resistant to the control agent. clarithromycin success rate, 36/45 (80%), control 31/33 (94%) M. catarrhalis clarithromycin success rate, 9/10 (90%), control 6/6 S. pyogenes clarithromycin success rate, 3/3, control 5/5 Overall clarithromycin success rate, 91/109 (83%), control 97/100 (97%) Safety The incidence of adverse events in all patients treated, primarily diarrhea (15% vs. 38%) and diaper rash (3% vs. 11%) in young children, was clinically and statistically lower in the clarithromycin arm versus the control arm. Duodenal Ulcer Associated with H. pylori Infection Clarithromycin + Lansoprazole and Amoxicillin H. pylori Eradication for Reducing the Risk of Duodenal Ulcer Recurrence Two U.S. randomized, double-blind clinical studies in patients with H. pylori and duodenal ulcer disease (defined as an active ulcer or history of an active ulcer within one year) evaluated the efficacy of clarithromycin in combination with lansoprazole and amoxicillin capsules as triple 14-day therapy for eradication of H. pylori. Based on the results of these studies, the safety and efficacy of the following eradication regimen were established: Triple therapy: Clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d. + Lansoprazole 30 mg b.i.d. + Amoxicillin 1 gm b.i.d. Treatment was for 14 days. H. pylori eradication was defined as two negative tests (culture and histology) at 4 to 6 weeks following the end of treatment. The combination of clarithromycin plus lansoprazole and amoxicillin as triple therapy was effective in eradicating H. pylori. Eradication of H. pylori has been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence. A randomized, double-blind clinical study performed in the U.S. in patients with H. pylori and duodenal ulcer disease (defined as an active ulcer or history of an ulcer within one year) compared the efficacy of clarithromycin in combination with lansoprazole and amoxicillin as triple therapy for 10 and 14 days. This study established that the 10-day triple therapy was equivalent to the 14-day triple therapy in eradicating H. pylori. H. pylori Eradication Rates-Triple Therapy (Clarithromycin/Lansoprazole/Amoxicillin) Percent of Patients Cured [95% Confidence Interval] (number of patients) Study Duration Triple Therapy Evaluable Analysis Based on evaluable patients with confirmed duodenal ulcer (active or within one year) and H. pylori infection at baseline defined as at least two of three positive endoscopic tests from CLOtest\u00ae (Delta West LTD., Bentley, Australia), histology, and/or culture. Patients were included in the analysis if they completed the study. Additionally, if patients were dropped out of the study due to an adverse event related to the study drug, they were included in the analysis as evaluable failures of therapy. Triple Therapy Intent-to-Treat Analysis Patients were included in the analysis if they had documented H. pylori infection at baseline as defined above and had a confirmed duodenal ulcer (active or within one year). All dropouts were included as failures of therapy. M93-131 14 days 92 (p<0.05) versus clarithromycin/lansoprazole and lansoprazole/amoxicillin dual therapy.

Two studies (Studies 126 and 127) were conducted in patients with an active duodenal ulcer, and the third study (Study 446) was conducted in patients with a duodenal ulcer in the past 5 years, but without an ulcer present at the time of enrollment. The dosage regimen in the studies was clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d. plus omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d. plus amoxicillin 1 gram b.i.d. for 10 days. In Studies 126 and 127, patients who took the omeprazole regimen also received an additional 18 days of omeprazole 20 mg q.d. Endpoints studied were eradication of H. pylori and duodenal ulcer healing (studies 126 and 127 only). H. pylori status was determined by CLOtest\u00ae, histology, and culture in all three studies. For a given patient, H. pylori was considered eradicated if at least two of these tests were negative, and none was positive. The combination of clarithromycin plus omeprazole and amoxicillin was effective in eradicating H. pylori. Per-Protocol and Intent-To-Treat H. pylori Eradication Rates % of Patients Cured [95% Confidence Interval] Clarithromycin + Omeprazole + Amoxicillin Clarithromycin + Amoxicillin Per- Protocol Patients were included in the analysis if they had confirmed duodenal ulcer disease (active ulcer studies 126 and 127; history of ulcer within 5 years, study M96-446) and H. pylori infection at baseline defined as at least two of three positive endoscopic tests from CLOtest\u00ae, histology, and/or culture. Patients were included in the analysis if they completed the study. Additionally, if patients dropped out of the study due to an adverse event related to the study drug, they were included in the analysis as failures of therapy. The impact of eradication on ulcer recurrence has not been assessed in patients with a past history of ulcer. Intent- To-Treat Patients were included in the analysis if they had documented H. pylori infection at baseline and had confirmed duodenal ulcer disease. All dropouts were included as failures of therapy.

Adverse reactions that have occurred have been limited to those that have been previously reported with clarithromycin, omeprazole, or amoxicillin. The most frequent adverse experiences observed in clinical trials using combination therapy with clarithromycin plus omeprazole and amoxicillin (n=274) were diarrhea (14%), taste perversion (10%), and headache (7%). For information about adverse reactions with omeprazole or amoxicillin, refer to the ADVERSE REACTIONS section of their package inserts. Clarithromycin + Omeprazole Therapy Four randomized, double-blind, multi-center studies (067, 100, 812b, and 058) evaluated clarithromycin 500 mg t.i.d. plus omeprazole 40 mg q.d. for 14 days, followed by omeprazole 20 mg q.d. (067, 100, and 058) or by omeprazole 40 mg q.d. (812b) for an additional 14 days in patients with active duodenal ulcer associated with H. pylori. Studies 067 and 100 were conducted in the U.S. and Canada and enrolled 242 and 256 patients, respectively. H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer were confirmed in 219 patients in Study 067 and 228 patients in Study 100. These studies compared the combination regimen to omeprazole and clarithromycin monotherapies. Studies 812b and 058 were conducted in Europe and enrolled 154 and 215 patients, respectively. H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer were confirmed in 148 patients in Study 812b and 208 patients in Study 058. These studies compared the combination regimen to omeprazole monotherapy. The results for the efficacy analyses for these studies are described below. Duodenal Ulcer Healing The combination of clarithromycin and omeprazole was as effective as omeprazole alone for healing duodenal ulcer.

In the per-protocol analysis, the following patients were excluded: dropouts, patients with major protocol violations, patients with missing H. pylori tests post-treatment, and patients that were not assessed for H. pylori eradication at 4 weeks after the end of treatment because they were found to have an unhealed ulcer at the end of treatment. Ulcer recurrence at 6-months following the end of treatment was assessed for patients in whom ulcers were healed post-treatment.

Safety The adverse event profiles for the four studies showed that the combination of clarithromycin 500 mg t.i.d. and omeprazole 40 mg q.d. for 14 days, followed by omeprazole 20 mg q.d. (067, 100, and 058) or 40 mg q.d.(812b) for an additional 14 days was well tolerated. Of the 346 patients who received the combination, 12 (3.5%) patients discontinued study drug due to adverse events. Adverse Events with an Incidence of 3% or Greater Adverse Event Clarithromycin + Omeprazole (n = 346) % of Patients Omeprazole (n = 355) % of Patients Clarithromycin (n = 166) % of Patients Studies 067 and 100, only Taste Perversion 15% 1% 16% Nausea 5% 1% 3% Headache 5% 6% 9% Diarrhea 4% 3% 7% Vomiting 4% <1% 1% Abdominal Pain 3% 2% 1% Infection 3% 4% 2% Most of these events were mild to moderate in severity. Changes in Laboratory Values Changes in laboratory values with possible clinical significance in patients taking clarithromycin and omeprazole were as follows: Hepatic\u2013\u2013 elevated direct bilirubin <1%; GGT <1%; SGOT (AST) <1%; SGPT (ALT) <1%. Renal\u2013\u2013 elevated serum creatinine <1%. For information on omeprazole, refer to the ADVERSE REACTIONS section of the PRILOSEC package insert. Clarithromycin + Ranitidine Bismuth Citrate Therapy In a U.S. double-blind, randomized, multicenter, dose-comparison trial, ranitidine bismuth citrate 400 mg b.i.d. for 4 weeks plus clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d. for the first 2 weeks was found to have an equivalent H. pylori eradication rate (based on culture and histology) when compared to ranitidine bismuth citrate 400 mg b.i.d. for 4 weeks plus clarithromycin 500 mg t.i.d. for the first 2 weeks. The intent-to-treat H. pylori eradication rates are shown below: H. pylori Eradication Rates in Study H2BA-3001 Analysis RBC 400 mg + Clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d. RBC 400 mg + Clarithromycin 500 mg t.i.d 95% CI Rate Difference ITT 65% (122/188) [58%, 72%] 63% (122/195) [55%, 69%] (-8%, 12%) Per-Protocol 72% (117/162) [65%, 79%] 71% (120/170) [63%,77%] (-9%, 12%) H. pylori eradication was defined as no positive test at 4 weeks following the end of treatment. Patients must have had two tests performed, and these must have been negative to be considered eradicated of H. pylori. The following patients were excluded from the per-protocol analysis: patients not infected with H. pylori prestudy, dropouts, patients with major protocol violations, patients with missing H. pylori tests. Patients excluded from the intent-to-treat analysis included those not infected with H. pylori prestudy and those with missing H. pylori tests prestudy. Patients were assessed for H. pylori eradication (4 weeks following treatment) regardless of their healing status (at the end of treatment). The relationship between H. pylori eradication and duodenal ulcer recurrence was assessed in a combined analysis of six U.S. randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled trials using ranitidine bismuth citrate with or without antibiotics. The results from approximately 650 U.S. patients showed that the risk of ulcer recurrence within 6 months of completing treatment was two times less likely in patients whose H. pylori infection was eradicated compared to patients in whom H. pylori infection was not eradicated. Safety In clinical trials using combination therapy with clarithromycin plus ranitidine bismuth citrate, no adverse reactions peculiar to the combination of these drugs (using clarithromycin twice daily or three times a day) were observed. Adverse reactions that have occurred have been limited to those reported with clarithromycin or ranitidine bismuth citrate. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS section of the Tritec package insert.) The most frequent adverse experiences observed in clinical trials using combination therapy with clarithromycin (500 mg three times a day) with ranitidine bismuth citrate (n = 329) were taste disturbance (11%), diarrhea (5%), nausea and vomiting (3%). The most frequent adverse experiences observed in clinical trials using combination therapy with clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) with ranitidine bismuth citrate (n = 196) were taste disturbance (8%), nausea and vomiting (5%), and diarrhea (4%)."

        "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics Clarithromycin is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration. The absolute bioavailability of 250 mg clarithromycin tablets was approximately 50%. For a single 500 mg dose of clarithromycin, food slightly delays the onset of clarithromycin absorption, increasing the peak time from approximately 2 to 2.5 hours. Food also increases the clarithromycin peak plasma concentration by about 24%, but does not affect the extent of clarithromycin bioavailability. Food does not affect the onset of formation of the antimicrobially active metabolite, 14-OH clarithromycin or its peak plasma concentration but does slightly decrease the extent of metabolite formation, indicated by an 11% decrease in area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). Therefore, clarithromycin tablets may be given without regard to food. In nonfasting healthy human subjects (males and females), peak plasma concentrations were attained within 2 to 3 hours after oral dosing. Steady-state peak plasma clarithromycin concentrations were attained within 3 days and were approximately 1 to 2 mcg/mL with a 250 mg dose administered every 12 hours and 3 to 4 mcg/mL with a 500 mg dose administered every 8 to 12 hours. The elimination half-life of clarithromycin was about 3 to 4 hours with 250 mg administered every 12 hours but increased to 5 to 7 hours with 500 mg administered every 8 to 12 hours. The nonlinearity of clarithromycin pharmacokinetics is slight at the recommended doses of 250 mg and 500 mg administered every 8 to 12 hours. With a 250 mg every 12 hours dosing, the principal metabolite, 14-OH clarithromycin, attains a peak steady-state concentration of about 0.6 mcg/mL and has an elimination half-life of 5 to 6 hours. With a 500 mg every 8 to 12 hours dosing, the peak steady-state concentration of 14-OH clarithromycin is slightly higher (up to 1 mcg/mL), and its elimination half-life is about 7 to 9 hours. With any of these dosing regimens, the steady-state concentration of this metabolite is generally attained within 3 to 4 days. After a 250 mg tablet every 12 hours, approximately 20% of the dose is excreted in the urine as clarithromycin, while after a 500 mg tablet every 12 hours, the urinary excretion of clarithromycin is somewhat greater, approximately 30%. In comparison, after an oral dose of 250 mg (125 mg/5 mL) suspension every 12 hours, approximately 40% is excreted in urine as clarithromycin. The renal clearance of clarithromycin is, however, relatively independent of the dose size and approximates the normal glomerular filtration rate. The major metabolite found in urine is 14-OH clarithromycin, which accounts for an additional 10% to 15% of the dose with either a 250 mg or a 500 mg tablet administered every 12 hours. Steady-state concentrations of clarithromycin and 14-OH clarithromycin observed following administration of 500 mg doses of clarithromycin every 12 hours to adult patients with HIV infection were similar to those observed in healthy volunteers. In adult HIV-infected patients taking 500 mg or 1000 mg doses of clarithromycin every 12 hours, steady-state clarithromycin C max values ranged from 2 to 4 mcg/mL and 5 to 10 mcg/mL, respectively. The steady-state concentrations of clarithromycin in subjects with impaired hepatic function did not differ from those in normal subjects; however, the 14-OH clarithromycin concentrations were lower in the hepatically impaired subjects. The decreased formation of 14-OH clarithromycin was at least partially offset by an increase in renal clearance of clarithromycin in the subjects with impaired hepatic function when compared to healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of clarithromycin was also altered in subjects with impaired renal function. (See PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Clarithromycin and the 14-OH clarithromycin metabolite distribute readily into body tissues and fluids. There are no data available on cerebrospinal fluid penetration. Because of high intracellular concentrations, tissue concentrations are higher than serum concentrations. Examples of tissue and serum concentrations are presented below. Concentration (after 250 mg q12h) Tissue Type Tissue (mcg/g) Serum (mcg/mL) Tonsil 1.6 0.8 Lung 8.8 1.7 Clarithromycin 500 mg every 8 hours was given in combination with omeprazole 40 mg daily to healthy adult males. The plasma levels of clarithromycin and 14-hydroxy-clarithromycin were increased by the concomitant administration of omeprazole. For clarithromycin, the mean C max was 10% greater, the mean C min was 27% greater, and the mean AUC 0-8 was 15% greater when clarithromycin was administered with omeprazole than when clarithromycin was administered alone. Similar results were seen for 14-hydroxy-clarithromycin, the mean C max was 45% greater, the mean C min was 57% greater, and the mean AUC 0-8 was 45% greater. Clarithromycin concentrations in the gastric tissue and mucus were also increased by concomitant administration of omeprazole.

Microbiology Clarithromycin exerts its antibacterial action by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible bacteria resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis. Clarithromycin is active in vitro against a variety of aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as most Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) bacteria. Additionally, the 14-OH clarithromycin metabolite also has clinically significant antimicrobial activity. The 14-OH clarithromycin is twice as active against Haemophilusinfluenzae microorganisms as the parent compound. However, for Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) isolates the 14-OH metabolite is 4 to 7 times less active than clarithromycin. The clinical significance of this activity against Mycobacterium avium complex is unknown. Clarithromycin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section: Gram-positive Microorganisms Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus pyogenes Gram-negative Microorganisms Haemophilusinfluenzae Haemophilusparainfluenzae Moraxellacatarrhalis Other Microorganisms Mycoplasmapneumoniae Chlamydia pneumoniae (TWAR) Mycobacteria Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) consisting of: Mycobacterium avium Mycobacterium intracellulare Beta-lactamase production should have no effect on clarithromycin activity. NOTE: Most isolates of methicillin-resistant and oxacillin-resistant staphylococci are resistant to clarithromycin. Omeprazole/clarithromycin dual therapy; ranitidine bismuth citrate/clarithromycin dual therapy; omeprazole/clarithromycin/amoxicillin triple therapy; and lansoprazole/clarithromycin/amoxicillin triple therapy have been shown to be active against most strains of Helicobacter pylori in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section. Helicobacter Helicobacter pylori Pretreatment Resistance Clarithromycin pretreatment resistance rates were 3.5% (4/113) in the omeprazole/clarithromycin dual-therapy studies (M93-067, M93-100) and 9.3% (41/439) in the omeprazole/clarithromycin/amoxicillin triple-therapy studies (126, 127, M96-446). Clarithromycin pretreatment resistance was 12.6% (44/348) in the ranitidine bismuth citrate/clarithromycin b.i.d. versus t.i.d. clinical study (H2BA3001). Clarithromycin pretreatment resistance rates were 9.5% (91/960) by E-test and 11.3% (12/106) by agar dilution in the lansoprazole/clarithromycin/amoxicillin triple-therapy clinical trials (M93-125, M93-130, M93-131, M95-392, and M95-399). Amoxicillin pretreatment susceptible isolates (<0.25 mcg/mL) were found in 99.3% (436/439) of the patients in the omeprazole/clarithromycin/amoxicillin clinical studies (126, 127, M96-446). Amoxicillin pretreatment minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) >0.25 mcg/mL occurred in 0.7% (3/439) of the patients, all of whom were in the clarithromycin/amoxicillin study arm. Amoxicillin pretreatment susceptible isolates (<0.25 mcg/mL) occurred in 97.8% (936/957) and 98.0% (98/100) of the patients in the lansoprazole/clarithromycin/amoxicillin triple-therapy clinical trials by E-test and agar dilution, respectively. Twenty-one of the 957 patients (2.2%) by E-test and 2 of 100 patients (2.0%) by agar dilution had amoxicillin pretreatment MICs of >0.25 mcg/mL. Two patients had an unconfirmed pretreatment amoxicillin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of >256 mcg/mL by E-test.

Therefore, for patients who fail therapy, clarithromycin susceptibility testing should be done, if possible. Patients with clarithromycin resistant H. pylori should not be treated with any of the following: omeprazole/clarithromycin dual therapy; ranitidine bismuth citrate/clarithromycin dual therapy; omeprazole/clarithromycin/amoxicillin triple therapy; lansoprazole/clarithromycin/amoxicillin triple therapy; or other regimens which include clarithromycin as the sole antimicrobial agent. Amoxicillin Susceptibility Test Results and Clinical/Bacteriological Outcomes In the omeprazole/clarithromycin/amoxicillin triple-therapy clinical trials, 84.9% (157/185) of the patients who had pretreatment amoxicillin susceptible MICs (<0.25 mcg/mL) were eradicated of H. pylori and 15.1% (28/185) failed therapy. Of the 28 patients who failed triple therapy, 11 had no post-treatment susceptibility test results, and 17 had post-treatment H. pylori isolates with amoxicillin susceptible MICs. Eleven of the patients who failed triple therapy also had post-treatment H. pylori isolates with clarithromycin resistant MICs. In the lansoprazole/clarithromycin/amoxicillin triple-therapy clinical trials, 82.6% (195/236) of the patients that had pretreatment amoxicillin susceptible MICs (<0.25 mcg/mL) were eradicated of H. pylori. Of those with pretreatment amoxicillin MICs of >0.25 mcg/mL, three of six had the H. pylori eradicated. A total of 12.8% (22/172) of the patients failed the 10-and 14-day triple-therapy regimens. Post-treatment susceptibility results were not obtained on 11 of the patients who failed therapy. Nine of the 11 patients with amoxicillin post-treatment MICs that failed the triple-therapy regimen also had clarithromycin resistant H. pylori isolates. The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown . Clarithromycin exhibits in vitro activity against most isolates of the following bacteria; however, the safety and effectiveness of clarithromycin in treating clinical infections due to these bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-positive Bacteria Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococci (Groups C, F, G) Viridans group streptococci Gram-negative Bacteria Bordetella pertussis Legionella pneumophila Pasteurella multocida Gram-positive Bacteria Clostridium perfringens Peptococcus niger Propionibacterium acnes Gram-negative Anaerobic Bacteria Prevotella melaninogenica (formerly Bacteriodes melaninogenicus ) Susceptibility Testing Methods (Excluding Mycobacteria and Helicobacter) Dilution Techniques Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized procedure. Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method 1 (broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of clarithromycin powder. The MIC values should be interpreted according to the following criteria: Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria for Staphylococcus aureus MIC (mcg/mL) Interpretation \u22642.0 Susceptible (S) 4.0 Intermediate (I) \u22658.0 Resistant (R) Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria for Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae These interpretive standards are applicable only to broth microdilution susceptibility tests using cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth with 2 to 5% lysed horse blood. MIC (mcg/mL) Interpretation \u22640.25 Susceptible (S) 0.5 Intermediate (I) \u22651.0 Resistant (R) For testing Haemophilus spp. These interpretive standards are applicable only to broth microdilution susceptibility tests with Haemophilus spp. using Haemophilus Testing Medium (HTM). 1 MIC (mcg/mL) Interpretation \u22648.0 Susceptible (S) 16.0 Intermediate (I) \u226532.0 Resistant (R) Note: When testing Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae , susceptibility and resistance to clarithromycin can be predicted using erythromycin. A report of \u201cSusceptible\u201d indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable. A report of \u201cIntermediate\u201d indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone which prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of \u201cResistant\u201d indicates that the pathogen is not likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable; other therapy should be selected. Quality Control Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control bacteria to monitor and ensure the accuracy and precision of supplies and reagents in the assay, and the techniques of the individual performing the test. 1,2 Standard clarithromycin powder should provide the following MIC ranges. QC Strain MIC (mcg/mL) S. aureus ATCC 29213 ATCC is a registered trademark of the American Type Culture Collection. 0.12 to 0.5 S. pneumoniae This quality control range is applicable only to S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619 tested by a microdilution procedure using cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth with 2 to 5% lysed horse blood. ATCC 49619 0.03 to 0.12 Haemophilus influenzae This quality control range is applicable only to H. influenzae ATCC 49247 tested by a microdilution procedure using HTM 1. ATCC 49247 4 to 16 Diffusion Techniques Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The zone size provides an estimate of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The zone size should be determined using a standardized method. 2,3 The procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 15 mcg of clarithromycin to test the susceptibility of bacteria.

Quality Control Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control bacteria to monitor and ensure the accuracy and precision of supplies and reagents in the assay, and the techniques of the individual performing the test. 2,3 For the diffusion technique using the 15 mcg disk, the criteria in the following table should be achieved. Acceptable Quality Control Ranges for Clarithromycin QC Strain Zone diameter (mm) S. aureus ATCC 25923 26 to 32 S. pneumoniae This quality control range is applicable only to tests performed by disk diffusion using Mueller-Hinton agar supplemented with 5% defibrinated sheep blood.

ATCC 49247 11 to 17 In vitro Activity of Clarithromycin against Mycobacteria Clarithromycin has demonstrated in vitro activity against Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) microorganisms isolated from both AIDS and non-AIDS patients. While gene probe techniques may be used to distinguish M. avium species from M. intracellulare, many studies only reported results on M. avium complex (MAC) isolates. Various in vitro methodologies employing broth or solid media at different pH\u2019s, with and without oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase (OADC), have been used to determine clarithromycin MIC values for mycobacterial species. In general, MIC values decrease more than 16-fold as the pH of Middlebrook 7H12 broth media increases from 5.0 to 7.4. At pH 7.4, MIC values determined with Mueller-Hinton agar were 4- to 8-fold higher than those observed with Middlebrook 7H12 media. Utilization of oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase (OADC) in these assays has been shown to further alter MIC values. Clarithromycin activity against 80 MAC isolates from AIDS patients and 211 MAC isolates from non-AIDS patients was evaluated using a micro-dilution method with Middlebrook 7H9 broth. Results showed an MIC value of \u22644.0 mcg/mL in 81% and 89% of the AIDS and non-AIDS MAC isolates, respectively. Twelve percent of the non-AIDS isolates had an MIC value \u22640.5 mcg/mL. Clarithromycin was also shown to be active against phagocytized M. avium complex (MAC) in mouse and human macrophage cell cultures as well as in the beige mouse infection model. Clarithromycin activity was evaluated against Mycobacterium tuberculosis microorganisms. In one study utilizing the agar dilution method with Middlebrook 7H10 media, 3 of 30 clinical isolates had an MIC of 2.5 mcg/mL. Clarithromycin inhibited all isolates at >10.0 mcg/mL. Susceptibility Testing for Mycobacterium avium Complex (MAC) The disk diffusion and dilution techniques for susceptibility testing against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria should not be used for determining clarithromycin MIC values against mycobacteria. In vitro susceptibility testing methods and diagnostic products currently available for determining minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values against Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) organisms have not been standardized or validated. Clarithromycin MIC values will vary depending on the susceptibility testing method employed, composition and pH of the media, and the utilization of nutritional supplements. Breakpoints to determine whether clinical isolates of M. avium or M. intracellulare are susceptible or resistant to clarithromycin have not been established. Susceptibility Test for Helicobacter pylori The reference methodology for susceptibility testing of H. pylori is agar dilution MICs 4 One to three micro-liters of an inoculum equivalent to a No. 2 McFarland standard (1 x 10 7 -1 x 10 8 CFU/mL for H. pylori ) are inoculated directly onto freshly prepared antimicrobial containing Mueller-Hinton agar plates with 5% aged defibrinated sheep blood (>2-weeks old). The agar dilution plates are incubated at 35\u00b0C in a microaerobic environment produced by a gas generating system suitable for Campylobacter species. After 3 days of incubation, the MICs are recorded as the lowest concentration of antimicrobial agent required to inhibit growth of the organism. The clarithromycin and amoxicillin MIC values should be interpreted according to the following criteria: Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria H. pylori Clarithromycin MIC (mcg/mL) These are tentative breakpoints for the agar dilution methodology, and should not be used to interpret results obtained using alternative methods. Interpretation <0.25 Susceptible (S) 0.5 Intermediate (I) >1.0 Resistant (R) Amoxicillin MIC (mcg/mL) There were not enough organisms with MICs >0.25 mcg/mL to determine a resistance breakpoint. Interpretation <0.25 Susceptible (S) Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control bacteria to monitor and ensure the accuracy and precision of supplies and reagents in the assay, and the techniques of the individual performing the test. Standard clarithromycin or amoxicillin powder should provide the following MIC ranges. Acceptable Quality Control Ranges Antimicrobial Agent MIC (mcg/mL) These are quality control ranges for the agar dilution methodology and should not be used to control test results obtained using alternative methods. H. pylori ATCC 43504 Clarithromycin 0.015 - 0.12 mcg/mL H. pylori ATCC 43504 Amoxicillin 0.015 - 0.12 mcg/mL"

        "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The following in vitro mutagenicity tests have been conducted with clarithromycin: Salmonella /Mammalian Microsomes Test Bacterial Induced Mutation Frequency Test In Vitro Chromosome Aberration Test Rat Hepatocyte DNA Synthesis Assay Mouse Lymphoma Assay Mouse Dominant Lethal Study Mouse Micronucleus Test All tests had negative results except the In Vitro Chromosome Aberration Test which was weakly positive in one test and negative in another. In addition, a Bacterial Reverse-Mutation Test (Ames Test) has been performed on clarithromycin metabolites with negative results. Fertility and reproduction studies have shown that daily doses of up to 160 mg/kg/day (1.3 times the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m 2 ) to male and female rats caused no adverse effects on the estrous cycle, fertility, parturition, or number and viability of offspring. Plasma levels in rats after 150 mg/kg/day were 2 times the human serum levels. In the 150 mg/kg/day monkey studies, plasma levels were 3 times the human serum levels. When given orally at 150 mg/kg/day (2.4 times the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m 2 ), clarithromycin was shown to produce embryonic loss in monkeys. This effect has been attributed to marked maternal toxicity of the drug at this high dose. In rabbits, in utero fetal loss occurred at an intravenous dose of 33 mg/m 2 , which is 17 times less than the maximum proposed human oral daily dose of 618 mg/m 2 . Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of clarithromycin."

      ],
      "description": [
        "NP Thyroid \u00ae (thyroid tablets, USP) for oral use is a natural preparation derived from porcine thyroid glands. They contain both tetraiodothyronine sodium (T 4 levothyroxine) and triiodothyronine sodium (T 3 liothyronine) providing 38 mcg levothyroxine (T 4 ) and 9 mcg liothyronine (T 3 ) per grain of thyroid. The inactive ingredients are calcium stearate, dextrose (agglomerated) and mineral oil. Contains no ingredient made from a gluten-containing grain (wheat, barley, rye)."
      ],
      "clinical_pharmacology": [
        "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The steps in the synthesis of the thyroid hormones are controlled by thyrotropin (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone, TSH) secreted by the anterior pituitary. This hormone\u2019s secretion is in turn controlled by a feedback mechanism effected by the thyroid hormones themselves and by thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), a tripeptide of hypothalamic origin. Endogenous thyroid hormone secretion is suppressed when exogenous thyroid hormones are administered to euthyroid individuals in excess of the normal gland\u2019s secretion. The mechanisms by which thyroid hormones exert their physiologic action are not well understood. These hormones enhance oxygen consumption by most tissues of the body, increase the basal metabolic rate, and the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. Thus, they exert a profound influence on every organ system in the body and are of particular importance in the development of the central nervous system. The normal thyroid gland contains approximately 200 mcg of levothyroxine (T 4 ) per gram of gland, and 15 mcg of liothyronine (T 3 ) per gram. The ratio of these two hormones in the circulation does not represent the ratio in the thyroid gland, since about 80 % of peripheral liothyronine (T 3 ) comes from monodeiodination of levothyroxine. Peripheral monodeiodination of levothyroxine at the 5 position (inner ring) also results in the formation of reverse liothyronine (T 3 ), which is calorigenically inactive. Liothyronine (T 3 ) levels are low in the fetus and newborn, in old age, in chronic caloric deprivation, hepatic cirrhosis, renal failure, surgical stress, and chronic illnesses representing what has been called the \u201cT 3 thyronine syndrome.\u201d"
      ],
      "pharmacokinetics": [
        "Pharmacokinetics - Animal studies have shown that T 4 is only partially absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The degree of absorption is dependent on the vehicle used for its administration and by the character of the intestinal contents, the intestinal flora, including plasma protein, and soluble dietary factors, all of which bind thyroid and thereby make it unavailable for diffusion. Only 41% is absorbed when given in a gelatin capsule as opposed to a 74% absorption when given with an albumin carrier. Depending on other factors, absorption has varied from 48 to 79% of the administered dose. Fasting increases absorption. Malabsorption syndromes, as well as dietary factors, (children\u2019s soybean formula, concomitant use of anionic exchange resins such as cholestyramine) cause excessive fecal loss. T 3 is almost totally absorbed, 95% in 4 hours. The hormones contained in the natural preparations are absorbed in a manner similar to the synthetic hormones. More than 99% of circulating hormones are bound to serum proteins, including thyroid-binding globulin (TBg), thyroid-binding prealbumin (TBPA), and albumin (TBa), whose capacities and affinities vary for the hormones. The higher affinity of levothyroxine (T 4 ) for both TBg and TBPA as compared to triiodothyronine (T 3 ) partially explains the higher serum levels and longer half-life of the former hormone. Both protein-bound hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with minute amounts of free hormone, the latter accounting for the metabolic activity. Deiodination of levothyroxine (T 4 ) occurs at a number of sites, including liver, kidney, and other tissues. The conjugated hormone, in the form of glucuronide or sulfate, is found in the bile and gut where it may complete an enterohepatic circulation. Eighty-five percent of levothyroxine (T 4 ) metabolized daily is deiodinated."

      "indications_and_usage": [
        "INDICATIONS AND USAGE NP Thyroid \u00ae tablets (thyroid tablets, USP) are indicated: 1. As replacement or supplemental therapy in patients with hypothyroidism of any etiology, except transient hypothyroidism during the recovery phase of subacute thyroiditis. This category includes cretinism, myxedema, and ordinary hypothyroidism in patients of any age (children, adults, the elderly), or state (including pregnancy); primary hypothyroidism resulting from functional deficiency, primary atrophy, partial or total absence of thyroid gland, or the effects of surgery, radiation, or drugs, with or without the presence of goiter; and secondary (pituitary), or tertiary (hypothalamic) hypothyroidism (See WARNINGS). 2. As pituitary TSH suppressants, in the treatment or prevention of various types of euthyroid goiters, including thyroid nodules, subacute or chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (Hashimoto\u2019s), multinodular goiter, and in the management of thyroid cancer."

      "contraindications": [
        "CONTRAINDICATIONS Thyroid hormone preparations are generally contraindicated in patients with diagnosed but as yet uncorrected adrenal cortical insufficiency, untreated thyrotoxicosis, and apparent hypersensitivity to any of their active or extraneous constituents. There is no well-documented evidence from the literature, however, of true allergic or idiosyncratic reactions to thyroid hormone."

In euthyroid patients, doses within the range of daily hormonal requirements are ineffective for weight reduction. Larger doses may produce serious or even life-threatening manifestations of toxicity, particularly when given in association with sympathomimetic amines such as those used for their anorectic effects. The use of thyroid hormones in the therapy of obesity, alone or combined with other drugs, is unjustified and has been shown to be ineffective. Neither is their use justified for the treatment of male or female infertility unless this condition is accompanied by hypothyroidism."

      ],
      "precautions": [
        "PRECAUTIONS General - Thyroid hormones should be used with great caution in a number of circumstances where the integrity of the cardiovascular system, particularly the coronary arteries, is suspected. These include patients with angina pectoris or the elderly, in whom there is a greater likelihood of occult cardiac disease. In these patients therapy should be initiated with low doses, i.e., 15-30 mg NP Thyroid\u00ae. When, in such patients, a euthyroid state can only be reached at the expense of an aggravation of the cardiovascular disease, thyroid hormone dosage should be reduced. Thyroid hormone therapy in patients with concomitant diabetes mellitus or diabetes insipidus or adrenal cortical insufficiency aggravates the intensity of their symptoms. Appropriate adjustments of the various therapeutic measures directed at these concomitant endocrine diseases are required. The therapy of myxedema coma requires simultaneous administration of glucocorticoids (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Hypothyroidism decreases and hyperthyroidism increases the sensitivity to oral anticoagulants. Prothrombin time should be closely monitored in thyroid-treated patients on oral anticoagulants and dosage of the latter agents adjusted on the basis of frequent prothrombin time determinations. In infants, excessive doses of thyroid hormone preparations may produce craniosynostosis."
      ],
      "information_for_patients": [
        "Information for the Patient - Patients on thyroid hormone preparations and parents of children on thyroid therapy should be informed that: 1. Replacement therapy is to be taken essentially for life, with the exception of cases of transient hypothyroidism, usually associated with thyroiditis, and in those patients receiving a therapeutic trial of the drug. 2. They should immediately report during the course of therapy any signs or symptoms of thyroid hormone toxicity, e.g., chest pain, increased pulse rate, palpitations, excessive sweating, heat intolerance, nervousness, or any other unusual event. 3. In case of concomitant diabetes mellitus, the daily dosage of antidiabetic medication may need readjustment as thyroid hormone replacement is achieved. If thyroid medication is stopped, a downward readjustment of the dosage of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agent may be necessary to avoid hypoglycemia. At all times, close monitoring of urinary glucose levels is mandatory in such patients. 4. In case of concomitant oral anticoagulant therapy, the prothrombin time should be measured frequently to determine if the dosage of oral anticoagulants is to be readjusted. 5. Instruct patients to discontinue biotin or any biotin-containing supplements for at least 2 days before thyroid function testing is conducted. 6. Partial loss of hair may be experienced by children in the first few months of thyroid therapy, but this is usually a transient phenomenon and later recovery is usually the rule."
      ],
      "laboratory_tests": [
        "Laboratory Tests - Treatment of patients with thyroid hormones requires the periodic assessment of thyroid status by means of appropriate laboratory tests besides the full clinical evaluation. The TSH suppression test can be used to test the effectiveness of any thyroid preparation bearing in mind the relative insensitivity of the infant pituitary to the negative feedback effect of thyroid hormones. Serum T 4 levels can be used to test the effectiveness of all thyroid medications except T 3 . When the total serum T 4 is low but TSH is normal, a test specific to assess unbound (free) T 4 levels is warranted. Specific measurements of T 4 and T 3 by competitive protein binding or radioimmunoassay are not influenced by blood levels of organic or inorganic iodine."
      ],
      "drug_interactions": [
        "Drug Interactions Oral Anticoagulants \u2014 Thyroid hormones appear to increase catabolism of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. If oral anticoagulants are also being given, compensatory increases in clotting factor synthesis are impaired. Patients stabilized on oral anticoagulants who are found to require thyroid replacement therapy should be watched very closely when thyroid is started. If a patient is truly hypothyroid, it is likely that a reduction in anticoagulant dosage will be required. No special precautions appear to be necessary when oral anticoagulant therapy is begun in a patient already stabilized on maintenance thyroid replacement therapy. Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemics \u2014 Initiating thyroid replacement therapy may cause increases in insulin or oral hypoglycemic requirements. The effects seen are poorly understood and depend upon a variety of factors such as dose and type of thyroid preparations and endocrine status of the patient. Patients receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemics should be closely watched during initiation of thyroid replacement therapy. Cholestyramine or Colestipol - Cholestyramine or colestipol binds both T 4 and T 3 in the intestine, thus impairing absorption of these thyroid hormones. In vitro studies indicate that the binding is not easily removed. Therefore, four to five hours should elapse between administration of cholestyramine and thyroid hormones. Estrogen, Oral Contraceptives \u2014 Estrogens tend to increase serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBg). In a patient with a nonfunctioning thyroid gland who is receiving thyroid replacement therapy, free levothyroxine may be decreased when estrogens are started thus increasing thyroid requirements. However, if the patient\u2019s thyroid gland has sufficient function, the decreased free levothyroxine will result in a compensatory increase in levothyroxine output by the thyroid. Therefore, patients without a functioning thyroid gland who are on thyroid replacement therapy may need to increase their thyroid dose if estrogens or estrogen-containing oral contraceptives are given."

      "drug_and_or_laboratory_test_interactions": [
        "Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions \u2014 The following drugs or moieties are known to interfere with laboratory tests performed in patients on thyroid hormone therapy: androgens, corticosteroids, estrogens, oral contraceptives containing estrogens, iodine-containing preparations, and the numerous preparations containing salicylates. 1. Changes in TBg concentration should be taken into consideration in the interpretation of T 4 and T 3 values. In such cases, the unbound (free) hormone should be measured. Pregnancy, estrogens, and estrogen-containing oral contraceptives increase TBg concentrations. TBg may also be increased during infectious hepatitis. Decreases in TBg concentrations are observed in nephrosis, acromegaly, and after androgen or corticosteroid therapy. Familial hyper- or hypothyroxine-binding-globulinemias have been described. The incidence of TBg deficiency approximates 1 in 9,000. The binding of levothyroxine by TBPA is inhibited by salicylates. 2. Biotin supplementation is known to interfere with thyroid hormone immunoassays that are based on a biotin and streptavidin interaction, which may result in erroneous thyroid hormone test results. Stop biotin and biotin-containing supplements for at least 2 days prior to thyroid testing. 3. Medicinal or dietary iodine interferes with all in vivo tests of radio-iodine uptake, producing low uptakes which may not be relative of a true decrease in hormone synthesis. 4. The persistence of clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism in spite of adequate dosage replacement indicates either poor patient compliance, poor absorption, excessive fecal loss, or inactivity of the preparation. Intracellular resistance to thyroid hormone is quite rare."

Routine determinations of serum T 4 and/or TSH is strongly advised in neonates in view of the deleterious effects of thyroid deficiency on growth and development. Treatment should be initiated immediately upon diagnosis, and maintained for life, unless transient hypothyroidism is suspected; in which case, therapy may be interrupted for 2 to 8 weeks after the age of 3 years to reassess the condition.

      "overdosage": [
        "OVERDOSAGE Signs and Symptoms - Excessive doses of thyroid result in a hypermetabolic state resembling in every respect the condition of endogenous origin. The condition may be self-induced. Treatment of Overdosage - Dosage should be reduced or therapy temporarily discontinued if signs and symptoms of overdosage appear. Treatment may be reinstituted at a lower dosage. In normal individuals, normal hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis function is restored in 6 to 8 weeks after thyroid suppression. Treatment of acute massive thyroid hormone overdosage is aimed at reducing gastrointestinal absorption of the drugs and counteracting central and peripheral effects, mainly those of increased sympathetic activity. Vomiting may be induced initially if further gastrointestinal absorption can reasonably be prevented and barring contraindications such as coma, convulsions, or loss of the gagging reflex. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Oxygen may be administered and ventilation maintained. Cardiac glycosides may be indicated if congestive heart failure develops. Measures to control fever, hypoglycemia, or fluid loss should be instituted if needed. Antiadrenergic agents, particularly propranolol, have been used advantageously in the treatment of increased sympathetic activity. Propranolol may be administered intravenously at a dosage of 1 to 3 mg, over a 10-minute period or orally, 80 to 160 mg/day, initially, especially when no contraindications exist for its use. Other adjunctive measures may include administration of cholestyramine to interfere with thyroxine absorption, and glucocorticoids to inhibit conversions of T 4 to T 3 ."
      ],
      "dosage_and_administration": [
        "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The dosage of thyroid hormones is determined by the indication and must in every case be individualized according to patient response and laboratory findings. Biotin supplementation may interfere with immunoassays for TSH, T 4 , and T 3 , resulting in erroneous thyroid hormone test results. Inquire whether patients are taking biotin or biotin-containing supplements. If so, advise them to stop biotin supplementation at least 2 days before assessing TSH and/or T 4 levels (see PRECAUTIONS). Thyroid hormones are given orally. In acute, emergency conditions, injectable levothyroxine sodium may be given intravenously when oral administration is not feasible or desirable, as in the treatment of myxedema coma, or during total parenteral nutrition. Intramuscular administration is not advisable because of reported poor absorption. Hypothyroidism - Therapy is usually instituted using low doses, with increments which depend on the cardiovascular status of the patient. The usual starting dose is 30 mg NP Thyroid \u00ae , with increments of 15 mg every 2 to 3 weeks. A lower starting dosage, 15 mg/day, is recommended in patients with long standing myxedema, particularly if cardiovascular impairment is suspected, in which case extreme caution is recommended. The appearance of angina is an indication for a reduction in dosage. Most patients require 60 to 120 mg/day. Failure to respond to doses of 180 mg suggests lack of compliance or malabsorption. Maintenance dosages 60 to 120 mg/day usually result in normal serum levothyroxine (T 4 ) and triiodothyronine (T 3 ) levels. Adequate therapy usually results in normal TSH and T 4 levels after 2 to 3 weeks of therapy. Readjustment of thyroid hormone dosage should be made within the first four weeks of therapy, after proper clinical and laboratory evaluations, including serum levels of T 4 , bound and free, and TSH. T 3 may be used in preference to levothyroxine (T 4 ) during radio-isotope scanning procedures, since induction of hypothyroidism in those cases is more abrupt and can be of shorter duration. It may also be preferred when impairment of peripheral conversion of T 4 and T 3 is suspected. Myxedema Coma - Myxedema coma is usually precipitated in the hypothyroid patient of long-standing by intercurrent illness or drugs such as sedatives and anesthetics and should be considered a medical emergency. Therapy should be directed at the correction of electrolyte disturbances and possible infection besides the administration of thyroid hormones. Corticosteroids should be administered routinely. T 4 and T 3 may be administered via a nasogastric tube but the preferred route of administration of both hormones is intravenous. Levothyroxine sodium (T 4 ) is given at starting dose of 400 mcg (100 mcg/mL) given rapidly, and is usually well tolerated, even in the elderly. This initial dose is followed by daily supplements of 100 to 200 mcg given intravenously. Normal T 4 levels are achieved in 24 hours followed in 3 days by threefold elevation of T 3 . Oral therapy with thyroid hormone would be resumed as soon as the clinical situation has been stabilized and the patient is able to take oral medication. Thyroid Cancer - Exogenous thyroid hormone may produce regression of metastases from follicular and papillary carcinoma of the thyroid and is used as ancillary therapy of these conditions with radioactive iodine. TSH should be suppressed to low or undetectable levels. Therefore, larger amounts of thyroid hormone than those used for replacement therapy are required. Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid is usually unresponsive to this therapy. Thyroid Suppression Therapy - Administration of thyroid hormone in doses higher than those produced physiologically by the gland results in suppression of the production of endogenous hormone. This is the basis for the thyroid suppression test and is used as an aid in the diagnosis of patients with signs of mild hyperthyroidism in whom base line laboratory tests appear normal, or to demonstrate thyroid gland autonomy in patients with Graves ophthalmopathy. 131I uptake is determined before and after the administration of the exogenous hormone. A 50% or greater suppression of uptake indicates a normal thyroid-pituitary axis and thus rules out thyroid gland autonomy. For adults, the usual suppressive dose of levothyroxine (T 4 ) is 1.56 mcg/kg of body weight per day given for 7 to 10 days. These doses usually yield normal serum T 4 and T 3 levels and lack of response to TSH. Thyroid hormones should be administered cautiously to patients in whom there is strong suspicion of thyroid gland autonomy, in view of the fact that the exogenous hormone effects will be additive to the endogenous source. Pediatric Dosage - Pediatric dosage should follow the recommendations summarized in Table 1. In infants with congenital hypothyroidism, therapy with full doses should be instituted as soon as the diagnosis has been made. Recommended Pediatric Dosage for Congenital Hypothyroidism NP Thyroid Tablets Age Dose per day Daily dose per kg of body weight 0 - 6 mos. 15 - 30 mg 4.8 - 6 mg 6 - 12 mos. 30 - 45 mg 3.6 - 4.8 mg 1 - 5 yrs. 45 - 60 mg 3 - 3.6 mg 6 - 12 yrs. 60 - 90 mg 2.4 - 3 mg Over 12 yrs.

        "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Begin varenicline tablets dosing one week before the date set by the patient to stop smoking. Alternatively, the patient can begin varenicline tablets dosing and then quit smoking between days 8 and 35 of treatment. ( 2.1 ) Starting Week: 0.5 mg once daily on days 1 to 3 and 0.5 mg twice daily on days 4 to 7. ( 2.1 ) Continuing Weeks: 1 mg twice daily for a total of 12 weeks. ( 2.1 ) An additional 12 weeks of treatment is recommended for successful quitters to increase likelihood of long-term abstinence. ( 2.1 ) Consider a gradual approach to quitting smoking with varenicline tablets for patients who are sure that they are not able or willing to quit abruptly. Patients should begin varenicline tablets dosing and reduce smoking by 50% from baseline within the first four weeks, by an additional 50% in the next four weeks, and continue reducing with the goal of reaching complete abstinence by 12 weeks. Continue treatment for an additional 12 weeks, for a total of 24 weeks. ( 2.1 ) Severe Renal Impairment (estimated creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min): Begin with 0.5 mg once daily and titrate to 0.5 mg twice daily. For patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing hemodialysis, a maximum of 0.5 mg daily may be given if tolerated. ( 2.2 ) Consider dose reduction for patients who cannot tolerate adverse effects. ( 2.1 ) Another attempt at treatment is recommended for those who fail to stop smoking or relapse when factors contributing to the failed attempt have been addressed. ( 2.1 ) Provide patients with appropriate educational materials and counseling to support the quit attempt. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Usual Dosage for Adults Smoking cessation therapies are more likely to succeed for patients who are motivated to stop smoking and who are provided additional advice and support. Provide patients with appropriate educational materials and counseling to support the quit attempt. The patient should set a date to stop smoking. Begin varenicline tablets dosing one week before this date. Alternatively, the patient can begin varenicline tablets dosing and then quit smoking between days 8 and 35 of treatment. Varenicline tablets should be taken orally after eating and with a full glass of water. The recommended dose of varenicline tablets are 1 mg twice daily following a 1-week titration as follows: Days 1 to 3: 0.5 mg once daily Days 4 to 7: 0.5 mg twice daily Day 8 to end of treatment: 1 mg twice daily Patients should be treated with varenicline tablets for 12 weeks. For patients who have successfully stopped smoking at the end of 12 weeks, an additional course of 12 weeks treatment with varenicline tablets are recommended to further increase the likelihood of long-term abstinence. For patients who are sure that they are not able or willing to quit abruptly, consider a gradual approach to quitting smoking with varenicline tablets. Patients should begin varenicline tablets dosing and reduce smoking by 50% from baseline within the first four weeks, by an additional 50% in the next four weeks, and continue reducing with the goal of reaching complete abstinence by 12 weeks. Continue varenicline tablets treatment for an additional 12 weeks, for a total of 24 weeks of treatment. Encourage patients to attempt quitting sooner if they feel ready [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ]. Patients who are motivated to quit, and who did not succeed in stopping smoking during prior varenicline tablets therapy for reasons other than intolerability due to adverse events or who relapsed after treatment, should be encouraged to make another attempt with varenicline tablets once factors contributing to the failed attempt have been identified and addressed. Consider a temporary or permanent dose reduction in patients who cannot tolerate the adverse effects of varenicline tablets. 2.2 Dosage in Special Populations Patients with Impaired Renal Function No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. For patients with severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance less than 30 mL per min), the recommended starting dose of varenicline tablets are 0.5 mg once daily. The dose may then be titrated as needed to a maximum dose of 0.5 mg twice daily. For patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing hemodialysis, a maximum dose of 0.5 mg once daily may be administered if tolerated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Elderly and Patients with Impaired Hepatic Function No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with hepatic impairment. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] ."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events: Postmarketing reports of serious or clinically significant neuropsychiatric adverse events have included changes in mood (including depression and mania), psychosis, hallucinations, paranoia, delusions, homicidal ideation, aggression, hostility, agitation, anxiety, and panic, as well as suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and completed suicide. Observe patients attempting to quit smoking with varenicline for the occurrence of such symptoms and instruct them to discontinue varenicline and contact a healthcare provider if they experience such adverse events. ( 5.1 ) Seizures: New or worsening seizures have been observed in patients taking varenicline. Varenicline should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or other factors that can lower the seizure threshold. ( 5.2 ) Interaction with Alcohol: Increased effects of alcohol have been reported. Instruct patients to reduce the amount of alcohol they consume until they know whether varenicline affects them. ( 5.3 ) Accidental Injury: Accidental injuries (e.g., traffic accidents) have been reported. Instruct patients to use caution driving or operating machinery until they know how varenicline may affect them. ( 5.4 ) Cardiovascular Events: Patients with underlying cardiovascular (CV) disease may be at increased risk of CV events; however, these concerns must be balanced with the health benefits of smoking cessation. Instruct patients to notify their healthcare providers of new or worsening CV symptoms and to seek immediate medical attention if they experience signs and symptoms of myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke. ( 5.5 and 6.1 ) Somnambulism: Cases of somnambulism have been reported in patients taking varenicline. Some cases described harmful behavior to self, others, or property. Instruct patients to discontinue varenicline and notify their healthcare provider if they experience somnambulism. ( 5.6 and 6.2 ) Angioedema and Hypersensitivity Reactions: Such reactions, including angioedema, infrequently life-threatening, have been reported. Instruct patients to discontinue varenicline and immediately seek medical care if symptoms occur. ( 5.7 and 6.2 ) Serious Skin Reactions: Rare, potentially life-threatening skin reactions have been reported. Instruct patients to discontinue varenicline and contact a healthcare provider immediately at first appearance of skin rash with mucosal lesions. ( 5.8 and 6.2 ) Nausea: Nausea is the most common adverse reaction (up to 30% incidence rate). Dose reduction may be helpful. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events including Suicidality Serious neuropsychiatric adverse events have been reported in patients being treated with varenicline [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . These postmarketing reports have included changes in mood (including depression and mania), psychosis, hallucinations, paranoia, delusions, homicidal ideation, aggression, hostility, agitation, anxiety, and panic, as well as suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and completed suicide. Some patients who stopped smoking may have been experiencing symptoms of nicotine withdrawal, including depressed mood. Depression, rarely including suicidal ideation, has been reported in smokers undergoing a smoking cessation attempt without medication. However, some of these adverse events occurred in patients taking varenicline who continued to smoke. Neuropsychiatric adverse events occurred in patients without and with pre-existing psychiatric disease; some patients experienced worsening of their psychiatric illnesses. Some neuropsychiatric adverse events, including unusual and sometimes aggressive behavior directed to oneself or others, may have been worsened by concomitant use of alcohol [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Observe patients for the occurrence of neuropsychiatric adverse events. Advise patients and caregivers that the patient should stop taking varenicline and contact a healthcare provider immediately if agitation, depressed mood, or changes in behavior or thinking that are not typical for the patient are observed, or if the patient develops suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior. The healthcare provider should evaluate the severity of the symptoms and the extent to which the patient is benefiting from treatment, and consider options including dose reduction, continued treatment under closer monitoring, or discontinuing treatment. In many postmarketing cases, resolution of symptoms after discontinuation of varenicline was reported. However, the symptoms persisted in some cases; therefore, ongoing monitoring and supportive care should be provided until symptoms resolve. The neuropsychiatric safety of varenicline was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, active and placebo-controlled study that included patients without a history of psychiatric disorder (non-psychiatric cohort, N=3912) and patients with a history of psychiatric disorder (psychiatric cohort, N=4003). In the non-psychiatric cohort, varenicline was not associated with an increased incidence of clinically significant neuropsychiatric adverse events in a composite endpoint comprising anxiety, depression, feeling abnormal, hostility, agitation, aggression, delusions, hallucinations, homicidal ideation, mania, panic, and irritability. In the psychiatric cohort, there were more events reported in each treatment group compared to the non-psychiatric cohort, and the incidence of events in the composite endpoint was higher for each of the active treatments compared to placebo: Risk Differences (RDs) (95%CI) vs. placebo were 2.7% (-0.05, 5.4) for varenicline, 2.2% (-0.5, 4.9) for bupropion, and 0.4% (-2.2, 3.0) for transdermal nicotine. In the non-psychiatric cohort, neuropsychiatric adverse events of a serious nature were reported in 0.1% of varenicline-treated patients and 0.4% of placebo-treated patients. In the psychiatric cohort, neuropsychiatric events of a serious nature were reported in 0.6% of varenicline-treated patients, with 0.5% involving psychiatric hospitalization. In placebo-treated patients, serious neuropsychiatric events occurred in 0.6%, with 0.2% requiring psychiatric hospitalization [see Clinical Studies (14.10) ] . 5.2 Seizures During clinical trials and the postmarketing experience, there have been reports of seizures in patients treated with varenicline. Some patients had no history of seizures, whereas others had a history of seizure disorder that was remote or well-controlled. In most cases, the seizure occurred within the first month of therapy. Weigh this potential risk against the potential benefits before prescribing varenicline in patients with a history of seizures or other factors that can lower the seizure threshold. Advise patients to discontinue varenicline and contact a healthcare provider immediately if they experience a seizure while on treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.3 Interaction with Alcohol There have been postmarketing reports of patients experiencing increased intoxicating effects of alcohol while taking varenicline. Some cases described unusual and sometimes aggressive behavior, and were often accompanied by amnesia for the events. Advise patients to reduce the amount of alcohol they consume while taking varenicline until they know whether varenicline affects their tolerance for alcohol [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . 5.4 Accidental Injury There have been postmarketing reports of traffic accidents, near-miss incidents in traffic, or other accidental injuries in patients taking varenicline. In some cases, the patients reported somnolence, dizziness, loss of consciousness or difficulty concentrating that resulted in impairment, or concern about potential impairment, in driving or operating machinery. Advise patients to use caution driving or operating machinery or engaging in other potentially hazardous activities until they know how varenicline may affect them. 5.5 Cardiovascular Events A comprehensive evaluation of cardiovascular (CV) risk with varenicline suggests that patients with underlying CV disease may be at increased risk; however, these concerns must be balanced with the health benefits of smoking cessation. CV risk has been assessed for varenicline in randomized controlled trials (RCT) and meta-analyses of RCTs. In a smoking cessation trial in patients with stable CV disease, CV events were infrequent overall; however, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) and nonfatal stroke occurred more frequently in patients treated with varenicline compared to placebo. All-cause and CV mortality was lower in patients treated with varenicline [see Clinical Studies (14.8) ] . This study was included in a meta-analysis of 15 varenicline efficacy trials in various clinical populations that showed an increased hazard ratio for Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) of 1.95; however, the finding was not statistically significant (95% CI: 0.79, 4.82). In the large postmarketing neuropsychiatric safety outcome trial, an analysis of adjudicated MACE events was conducted for patients while in the trial and during a 28-week non-treatment extension period. Few MACE events occurred during the trial; therefore, the findings did not contribute substantively to the understanding of CV risk with varenicline. Instruct patients to notify their healthcare providers of new or worsening CV symptoms and to seek immediate medical attention if they experience signs and symptoms of MI or stroke [see Clinical Studies (14.10) ]. 5.6 Somnambulism Cases of somnambulism have been reported in patients taking varenicline. Some cases described harmful behavior to self, others, or property. Instruct patients to discontinue varenicline and notify their healthcare provider if they experience somnambulism [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . 5.7 Angioedema and Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients treated with varenicline [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Patient Counseling Information (17) ] . Clinical signs included swelling of the face, mouth (tongue, lips, and gums), extremities, and neck (throat and larynx). There were infrequent reports of life-threatening angioedema requiring emergent medical attention due to respiratory compromise. Instruct patients to discontinue varenicline and immediately seek medical care if they experience these symptoms. 5.8 Serious Skin Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of rare but serious skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and erythema multiforme, in patients using varenicline [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. As these skin reactions can be life-threatening, instruct patients to stop taking varenicline and contact a healthcare provider immediately at the first appearance of a skin rash with mucosal lesions or any other signs of hypersensitivity. 5.9 Nausea Nausea was the most common adverse reaction reported with varenicline treatment. Nausea was generally described as mild or moderate and often transient; however, for some patients, it was persistent over several months. The incidence of nausea was dose-dependent. Initial dose-titration was beneficial in reducing the occurrence of nausea. For patients treated to the maximum recommended dose of 1 mg twice daily following initial dosage titration, the incidence of nausea was 30% compared with 10% in patients taking a comparable placebo regimen. In patients taking varenicline 0.5 mg twice daily following initial titration, the incidence was 16% compared with 11% for placebo. Approximately 3% of patients treated with varenicline 1 mg twice daily in studies involving 12 weeks of treatment discontinued treatment prematurely because of nausea. For patients with intolerable nausea, a dose reduction should be considered."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions were reported in postmarketing experience and are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events including Suicidality [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Interaction with Alcohol [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Accidental Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Cardiovascular Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Somnambulism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Angioedema and Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Serious Skin Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] In the placebo-controlled premarketing studies, the most common adverse events associated with varenicline (>5% and twice the rate seen in placebo-treated patients) were nausea, abnormal (vivid, unusual, or strange) dreams, constipation, flatulence, and vomiting. The treatment discontinuation rate due to adverse events in patients dosed with 1 mg twice daily was 12% for varenicline, compared to 10% for placebo in studies of three months\u2019 treatment. In this group, the discontinuation rates that are higher than placebo for the most common adverse events in varenicline-treated patients were as follows: nausea (3% vs. 0.5% for placebo), insomnia (1.2% vs. 1.1% for placebo), and abnormal dreams (0.3% vs. 0.2% for placebo). Smoking cessation, with or without treatment, is associated with nicotine withdrawal symptoms and has also been associated with the exacerbation of underlying psychiatric illness. Most common adverse reactions (>5% and twice the rate seen in placebo-treated patients) were nausea, abnormal (e.g., vivid, unusual, or strange) dreams, constipation, flatulence, and vomiting.

During the premarketing development of varenicline, over 4500 subjects were exposed to varenicline, with over 450 treated for at least 24 weeks and approximately 100 for a year. Most study participants were treated for 12 weeks or less. The most common adverse event associated with varenicline treatment is nausea, occurring in 30% of patients treated at the recommended dose, compared with 10% in patients taking a comparable placebo regimen [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Table 1 shows the adverse events for varenicline and placebo in the 12- week fixed dose premarketing studies with titration in the first week [Studies 2 (titrated arm only), 4, and 5]. Adverse events were categorized using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA, Version 7.1). MedDRA High Level Group Terms (HLGT) reported in \u22655% of patients in the varenicline 1 mg twice daily dose group, and more commonly than in the placebo group, are listed, along with subordinate Preferred Terms (PT) reported in \u22651% of varenicline patients (and at least 0.5% more frequent than placebo). Closely related Preferred Terms such as \u2018Insomnia\u2019, \u2018Initial insomnia\u2019, \u2018Middle insomnia\u2019, \u2018Early morning awakening\u2019 were grouped, but individual patients reporting two or more grouped events are only counted once.

Following is a list of treatment-emergent adverse events reported by patients treated with varenicline during all premarketing clinical trials and updated based on pooled data from 18 placebo-controlled pre- and postmarketing studies, including approximately 5,000 patients treated with varenicline. Adverse events were categorized using MedDRA, Version 16.0. The listing does not include those events already listed in the previous tables or elsewhere in labeling, those events for which a drug cause was remote, those events which were so general as to be uninformative, and those events reported only once which did not have a substantial probability of being acutely life-threatening.

Varenicline has also been studied in postmarketing trials including (1) a trial conducted in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), (2) a trial conducted in generally healthy patients (similar to those in the premarketing studies) in which they were allowed to select a quit date between days 8 and 35 of treatment (\u201calternative quit date instruction trial\u201d), (3) a trial conducted in patients who did not succeed in stopping smoking during prior varenicline therapy, or who relapsed after treatment (\u201cre-treatment trial\u201d), (4) a trial conducted in patients with stable cardiovascular disease, (5) a trial conducted in patients with stable schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, (6) a trial conducted in patients with major depressive disorder, (7) a postmarketing neuropsychiatric safety outcome trial in patients without or with a history of psychiatric disorder, (8) a non-treatment extension of the postmarketing neuropsychiatric safety outcome trial that assessed CV safety, (9) a trial in patients who were not able or willing to quit abruptly and who were instructed to quit gradually (\u201cgradual approach to quitting smoking trial\u201d). Adverse events in the trial of patients with COPD (1), in the alternative quit date instruction trial (2), and in the gradual approach to quitting smoking trial (9) were similar to those observed in premarketing studies. In the re-treatment trial (3), the profile of common adverse events was similar to that previously reported, but, in addition, varenicline-treated patients also commonly reported diarrhea (6% vs. 4% in placebo-treated patients), depressed mood disorders and disturbances (6% vs. 1%), and other mood disorders and disturbances (5% vs. 2%). In the trial of patients with stable cardiovascular disease (4), more types and a greater number of cardiovascular events were reported compared to premarketing studies, as shown in Table 1 and in Table 2 below. Table 2.

The most common treatment emergent adverse events reported in this trial are shown in Table 3 below. Table 3.

Additionally, in this trial, patients treated with varenicline were more likely than patients treated with placebo to report one of events related to hostility and aggression (3% vs. 1%). Table 4.

Most common treatment-emergent adverse events reported in this trial are shown in Table 5 below. Table 5.

Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. There have been reports of depression, mania, psychosis, hallucinations, paranoia, delusions, homicidal ideation, aggression, hostility, anxiety, and panic, as well as suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and completed suicide in patients attempting to quit smoking while taking varenicline [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . There have been postmarketing reports of new or worsening seizures in patients treated with varenicline [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. There have been postmarketing reports of patients experiencing increased intoxicating effects of alcohol while taking varenicline. Some reported neuropsychiatric events, including unusual and sometimes aggressive behavior [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and (5.3) ] . There have been reports of hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . There have also been reports of serious skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and erythema multiforme, in patients taking varenicline [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. There have been reports of myocardial infarction (MI) and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) including ischemic and hemorrhagic events in patients taking varenicline. In the majority of the reported cases, patients had pre-existing cardiovascular disease and/or other risk factors. Although smoking is a risk factor for MI and CVA, based on temporal relationship between medication use and events, a contributory role of varenicline cannot be ruled out [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . There have been reports of hyperglycemia in patients following initiation of varenicline. There have been reports of somnambulism, some resulting in harmful behavior to self, others, or property in patients treated with varenicline [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] ."

Other Smoking Cessation Therapies: Safety and efficacy in combination with other smoking cessation therapies has not been established. Coadministration of varenicline and transdermal nicotine resulted in a high rate of discontinuation due to adverse events. ( 7.1 ) Effect of Smoking Cessation on Other Drugs: Pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of certain drugs (e.g., theophylline, warfarin, insulin) may be altered, necessitating dose adjustment. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Use with Other Drugs for Smoking Cessation Safety and efficacy of varenicline in combination with other smoking cessation therapies have not been studied. Bupropion Varenicline (1 mg twice daily) did not alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of bupropion (150 mg twice daily) in 46 smokers. The safety of the combination of bupropion and varenicline has not been established. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) Although co-administration of varenicline (1 mg twice daily) and transdermal nicotine (21 mg/day) for up to 12 days did not affect nicotine pharmacokinetics, the incidence of nausea, headache, vomiting, dizziness, dyspepsia, and fatigue was greater for the combination than for NRT alone. In this study, eight of twenty-two (36%) patients treated with the combination of varenicline and NRT prematurely discontinued treatment due to adverse events, compared to 1 of 17 (6%) of patients treated with NRT and placebo. 7.2 Effect of Smoking Cessation on Other Drugs Physiological changes resulting from smoking cessation, with or without treatment with varenicline, may alter the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of certain drugs (e.g., theophylline, warfarin, insulin) for which dosage adjustment may be necessary."

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data have not suggested an increased risk for major birth defects following exposure to varenicline in pregnancy, compared with women who smoke [see Data]. Smoking during pregnancy is associated with maternal, fetal, and neonatal risks (see Clinical Considerations) . In animal studies, varenicline did not result in major malformations but caused decreased fetal weights in rabbits when dosed during organogenesis at exposures equivalent to 50 times the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). Additionally, administration of varenicline to pregnant rats during organogenesis through lactation produced developmental toxicity in offspring at maternal exposures equivalent to 36 times human exposure at the MRHD [see Data] . The estimated background risk of oral clefts is increased by approximately 30% in infants of women who smoke during pregnancy, compared to pregnant women who do not smoke. The background risk of other major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Smoking during pregnancy causes increased risks of orofacial clefts, premature rupture of membranes, placenta previa, placental abruption, ectopic pregnancy, fetal growth restriction and low birth weight, stillbirth, preterm delivery and shortened gestation, neonatal death, sudden infant death syndrome and reduction of lung function in infants. It is not known whether quitting smoking with varenicline during pregnancy reduces these risks. Data Human Data A population-based observational cohort study using the national registers of Denmark and Sweden compared pregnancy and birth outcomes among women exposed to varenicline (N=335, includes 317 first trimester exposed) with women who smoked during pregnancy (N=78,412) and with non-smoking pregnant women (N=806,438). The prevalence of major malformations, the primary outcome, was similar in all groups, including between smoking and non-smoking groups. The prevalence of adverse perinatal outcomes in the varenicline-exposed cohort was not greater than in the cohort of women who smoked, and differed somewhat between the three cohorts. The prevalences of the primary and secondary outcomes are shown in Table 6. Table 6. Summary of Primary and Secondary Outcomes for Three Birth Cohorts Outcome Varenicline Cohort (n=335) Smoking Cohort (n=78,412) Non-Smoking Cohort (n=806,438) * Included only live births in the cohorts. Prevalence among first trimester varenicline-exposed pregnancies (11/317 [3.5%]). ** There was a lag in death data in Denmark, so the cohorts were smaller. Major congenital malformation * 12 / 334 (3.6%) 3,382 / 78,028 (4.3%) 33,950 /804,020 (4.2%) Stillbirth 1 (0.3%) 384 (0.5%) 2,418 (0.3%) Small for gestational age 42 (12.5%) 13,433 (17.1%) 73,135 (9.1%) Preterm birth 25 (7.5%) 6,173 (7.9%) 46,732 (5.8%) Premature rupture of membranes 12 (3.6%) 4,246 (5.4%) 30,641 (3.8%) Sudden infant death syndrome ** 0/307 (0.0%) 51/71,720 (0.1%) 58/755,939 (<0.1%) The study limitations include the inability to capture malformations in pregnancies that do not result in a live birth, and possible misclassification of outcome and of exposure to varenicline or to smoking. Other small epidemiological studies of pregnant women exposed to varenicline did not identify an association with major malformations, consistent with the Danish and Swedish observational cohort study. Methodological limitations of these studies include small samples and lack of adequate controls. Overall, available studies cannot definitely establish or exclude any varenicline-associated risk during pregnancy. Animal Data Pregnant rats and rabbits received varenicline succinate during organogenesis at oral doses up to 15 and 30 mg/kg/day, respectively. While no fetal structural abnormalities occurred in either species, maternal toxicity, characterized by reduced body weight gain, and reduced fetal weights occurred in rabbits at the highest dose (exposures 50 times the human exposure at the MRHD of 1 mg twice daily based on AUC). Fetal weight reduction did not occur in rabbits at exposures 23 times the human exposure at the MRHD based on AUC. In a pre- and postnatal development study, pregnant rats received up to 15 mg/kg/day of oral varenicline succinate from organogenesis through lactation. Maternal toxicity, characterized by a decrease in body weight gain was observed at 15 mg/kg/day (36 times the human exposure at the MRHD based on AUC). However, decreased fertility and increased auditory startle response occurred in offspring at the highest maternal dose of 15 mg/kg/day. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of varenicline in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. In animal studies varenicline was present in milk of lactating rats [see Data] . However, due to species-specific differences in lactation physiology, animal data may not reliably predict drug levels in human milk. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of varenicline to an infant during lactation; however the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for varenicline and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from varenicline or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Because there are no data on the presence of varenicline in human milk and the effects on the breastfed infant, breastfeeding women should monitor their infant for seizures and excessive vomiting, which are adverse reactions that have occurred in adults that may be clinically relevant in breastfeeding infants. Data In a pre- and postnatal development study, pregnant rats received up to 15 mg/kg/day of oral varenicline succinate through gestation and lactation Mean serum concentrations of varenicline in the nursing pups were 5 to 22% of maternal serum concentrations. 8.4 Pediatric Use Varenicline is not recommended for use in pediatric patients 16 years of age or younger because its efficacy in this population was not demonstrated. Single and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of varenicline have been investigated in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years old (inclusive) and were approximately dose-proportional over the 0.5 mg to 2 mg daily dose range studied. Steady-state systemic exposure in adolescent patients of bodyweight >55 kg, as assessed by AUC (0 to 24), was comparable to that noted for the same doses in the adult population. When 0.5 mg BID was given, steady-state daily exposure of varenicline was, on average, higher (by approximately 40%) in adolescent patients with bodyweight \u2264 55 kg compared to that noted in the adult population. The efficacy and safety of varenicline was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 312 patients aged 12 to 19 years, who smoked an average of at least 5 cigarettes per day during the 30 days prior to recruitment, had a score of at least 4 on the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence scale, and at least one previous failed quit attempt. Patients were stratified by age (12 to 16 years of age, n = 216 and 17 to 19 years of age, n = 96) and by body weight (\u226455 kg and >55 kg). Patients were randomized to one of two doses of varenicline, adjusted by weight to provide plasma levels in the efficacious range (based on adult studies) and placebo. Patients received treatment for 12 weeks, followed by a non-treatment period of 40 weeks, along with age-appropriate counseling throughout the study. Results from this study showed that varenicline, at either dose studied, did not improve continuous abstinence rates at weeks 9 through 12 of treatment compared with placebo in subjects 12 to 19 years of age. The varenicline safety profile in this study was consistent with that observed in adult studies. 8.5 Geriatric Use A combined single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics of 1 mg varenicline given once daily or twice daily to 16 healthy elderly male and female smokers (aged 65 to 75 years) for 7 consecutive days was similar to that of younger subjects. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Varenicline is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . No dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment Varenicline is substantially eliminated by renal glomerular filtration along with active tubular secretion. Dose reduction is not required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. For patients with severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance <30 mL/min), and for patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing hemodialysis, dosage adjustment is needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

In animal studies, varenicline did not result in major malformations but caused decreased fetal weights in rabbits when dosed during organogenesis at exposures equivalent to 50 times the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). Additionally, administration of varenicline to pregnant rats during organogenesis through lactation produced developmental toxicity in offspring at maternal exposures equivalent to 36 times human exposure at the MRHD [see Data] . The estimated background risk of oral clefts is increased by approximately 30% in infants of women who smoke during pregnancy, compared to pregnant women who do not smoke. The background risk of other major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Smoking during pregnancy causes increased risks of orofacial clefts, premature rupture of membranes, placenta previa, placental abruption, ectopic pregnancy, fetal growth restriction and low birth weight, stillbirth, preterm delivery and shortened gestation, neonatal death, sudden infant death syndrome and reduction of lung function in infants. It is not known whether quitting smoking with varenicline during pregnancy reduces these risks. Data Human Data A population-based observational cohort study using the national registers of Denmark and Sweden compared pregnancy and birth outcomes among women exposed to varenicline (N=335, includes 317 first trimester exposed) with women who smoked during pregnancy (N=78,412) and with non-smoking pregnant women (N=806,438). The prevalence of major malformations, the primary outcome, was similar in all groups, including between smoking and non-smoking groups. The prevalence of adverse perinatal outcomes in the varenicline-exposed cohort was not greater than in the cohort of women who smoked, and differed somewhat between the three cohorts. The prevalences of the primary and secondary outcomes are shown in Table 6. Table 6. Summary of Primary and Secondary Outcomes for Three Birth Cohorts Outcome Varenicline Cohort (n=335) Smoking Cohort (n=78,412) Non-Smoking Cohort (n=806,438) * Included only live births in the cohorts.

Other small epidemiological studies of pregnant women exposed to varenicline did not identify an association with major malformations, consistent with the Danish and Swedish observational cohort study. Methodological limitations of these studies include small samples and lack of adequate controls. Overall, available studies cannot definitely establish or exclude any varenicline-associated risk during pregnancy. Animal Data Pregnant rats and rabbits received varenicline succinate during organogenesis at oral doses up to 15 and 30 mg/kg/day, respectively. While no fetal structural abnormalities occurred in either species, maternal toxicity, characterized by reduced body weight gain, and reduced fetal weights occurred in rabbits at the highest dose (exposures 50 times the human exposure at the MRHD of 1 mg twice daily based on AUC). Fetal weight reduction did not occur in rabbits at exposures 23 times the human exposure at the MRHD based on AUC. In a pre- and postnatal development study, pregnant rats received up to 15 mg/kg/day of oral varenicline succinate from organogenesis through lactation. Maternal toxicity, characterized by a decrease in body weight gain was observed at 15 mg/kg/day (36 times the human exposure at the MRHD based on AUC). However, decreased fertility and increased auditory startle response occurred in offspring at the highest maternal dose of 15 mg/kg/day."

        "8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of varenicline in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. In animal studies varenicline was present in milk of lactating rats [see Data] . However, due to species-specific differences in lactation physiology, animal data may not reliably predict drug levels in human milk. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of varenicline to an infant during lactation; however the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for varenicline and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from varenicline or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Because there are no data on the presence of varenicline in human milk and the effects on the breastfed infant, breastfeeding women should monitor their infant for seizures and excessive vomiting, which are adverse reactions that have occurred in adults that may be clinically relevant in breastfeeding infants. Data In a pre- and postnatal development study, pregnant rats received up to 15 mg/kg/day of oral varenicline succinate through gestation and lactation Mean serum concentrations of varenicline in the nursing pups were 5 to 22% of maternal serum concentrations."

        "8.4 Pediatric Use Varenicline is not recommended for use in pediatric patients 16 years of age or younger because its efficacy in this population was not demonstrated. Single and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of varenicline have been investigated in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years old (inclusive) and were approximately dose-proportional over the 0.5 mg to 2 mg daily dose range studied. Steady-state systemic exposure in adolescent patients of bodyweight >55 kg, as assessed by AUC (0 to 24), was comparable to that noted for the same doses in the adult population. When 0.5 mg BID was given, steady-state daily exposure of varenicline was, on average, higher (by approximately 40%) in adolescent patients with bodyweight \u2264 55 kg compared to that noted in the adult population. The efficacy and safety of varenicline was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 312 patients aged 12 to 19 years, who smoked an average of at least 5 cigarettes per day during the 30 days prior to recruitment, had a score of at least 4 on the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence scale, and at least one previous failed quit attempt. Patients were stratified by age (12 to 16 years of age, n = 216 and 17 to 19 years of age, n = 96) and by body weight (\u226455 kg and >55 kg). Patients were randomized to one of two doses of varenicline, adjusted by weight to provide plasma levels in the efficacious range (based on adult studies) and placebo. Patients received treatment for 12 weeks, followed by a non-treatment period of 40 weeks, along with age-appropriate counseling throughout the study. Results from this study showed that varenicline, at either dose studied, did not improve continuous abstinence rates at weeks 9 through 12 of treatment compared with placebo in subjects 12 to 19 years of age. The varenicline safety profile in this study was consistent with that observed in adult studies."

No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Varenicline is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . No dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients."

At higher doses (greater than 2 mg), varenicline produced more frequent reports of gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting. There is no evidence of dose-escalation to maintain therapeutic effects in clinical studies, which suggests that tolerance does not develop. Abrupt discontinuation of varenicline was associated with an increase in irritability and sleep disturbances in up to 3% of patients. This suggests that, in some patients, varenicline may produce mild physical dependence which is not associated with addiction. In a human laboratory abuse liability study, a single oral dose of 1 mg varenicline did not produce any significant positive or negative subjective responses in smokers. In non-smokers, 1 mg varenicline produced an increase in some positive subjective effects, but this was accompanied by an increase in negative adverse effects, especially nausea. A single oral dose of 3 mg varenicline uniformly produced unpleasant subjective responses in both smokers and non-smokers. Animals Studies in rodents have shown that varenicline produces behavioral responses similar to those produced by nicotine. In rats trained to discriminate nicotine from saline, varenicline produced full generalization to the nicotine cue. In self-administration studies, the degree to which varenicline substitutes for nicotine is dependent upon the requirement of the task. Rats trained to self-administer nicotine under easy conditions continued to self-administer varenicline to a degree comparable to that of nicotine; however in a more demanding task, rats self-administered varenicline to a lesser extent than nicotine. Varenicline pretreatment also reduced nicotine self-administration."

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Varenicline binds with high affinity and selectivity at \u03b14\u03b22 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. The efficacy of varenicline in smoking cessation is believed to be the result of varenicline\u2019s activity at \u03b14\u03b22 sub-type of the nicotinic receptor where its binding produces agonist activity, while simultaneously preventing nicotine binding to these receptors. Electrophysiology studies in vitro and neurochemical studies in vivo have shown that varenicline binds to \u03b14\u03b22 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and stimulates receptor-mediated activity, but at a significantly lower level than nicotine. Varenicline blocks the ability of nicotine to activate \u03b14\u03b22 receptors and thus to stimulate the central nervous mesolimbic dopamine system, believed to be the neuronal mechanism underlying reinforcement and reward experienced upon smoking. Varenicline is highly selective and binds more potently to \u03b14\u03b22 receptors than to other common nicotinic receptors (>500-fold \u03b13\u03b24, >3,500-fold \u03b17, >20,000-fold \u03b11\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4), or to non-nicotinic receptors and transporters (>2,000-fold). Varenicline also binds with moderate affinity (Ki = 350 nM) to the 5-HT3 receptor. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Maximum plasma concentrations of varenicline occur typically within 3 to 4 hours after oral administration. Following administration of multiple oral doses of varenicline, steady-state conditions were reached within 4 days. Over the recommended dosing range, varenicline exhibits linear pharmacokinetics after single or repeated doses. In a mass balance study, absorption of varenicline was virtually complete after oral administration and systemic availability was ~90%. Food Effect Oral bioavailability of varenicline is unaffected by food or time-of-day dosing. Distribution Plasma protein binding of varenicline is low (\u226420%) and independent of both age and renal function. Elimination The elimination half-life of varenicline is approximately 24 hours. Metabolism Varenicline undergoes minimal metabolism, with 92% excreted unchanged in the urine. Excretion Renal elimination of varenicline is primarily through glomerular filtration along with active tubular secretion possibly via the organic cation transporter, OCT2. Specific Populations There are no clinically meaningful differences in varenicline pharmacokinetics due to age, race, gender, smoking status, or use of concomitant medications, as demonstrated in specific pharmacokinetic studies and in population pharmacokinetic analyses. Age: Geriatric Patients A combined single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics of 1 mg varenicline given once daily or twice daily to 16 healthy elderly male and female smokers (aged 65 to 75 years) for 7 consecutive days was similar to that of younger subjects. Age: Pediatric Patients Varenicline is not recommended for use in pediatric patients 16 years of age or younger because its efficacy in this population was not demonstrated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . Renal Impairment Varenicline pharmacokinetics were unchanged in subjects with mild renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance >50 mL/min and \u226480 mL/min). In subjects with moderate renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance \u226530 mL/min and \u226450 mL/min), varenicline exposure increased 1.5-fold compared with subjects with normal renal function (estimated creatinine clearance >80 mL/min). In subjects with severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance <30 mL/min), varenicline exposure was increased 2.1-fold. In subjects with end-stage-renal disease (ESRD) undergoing a three-hour session of hemodialysis for three days a week, varenicline exposure was increased 2.7-fold following 0.5 mg once daily administration for 12 days. The plasma Cmax and AUC of varenicline noted in this setting were similar to those of healthy subjects receiving 1 mg twice daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Additionally, in subjects with ESRD, varenicline was efficiently removed by hemodialysis [see Overdosage (10) ]. Hepatic Impairment Due to the absence of significant hepatic metabolism, varenicline pharmacokinetics should be unaffected in patients with hepatic impairment. Drug-Drug Interactions In vitro studies demonstrated that varenicline does not inhibit the following cytochrome P450 enzymes (IC50 >6400 ng/mL): 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4/5. Also, in human hepatocytes in vitro , varenicline does not induce the cytochrome P450 enzymes 1A2 and 3A4. In vitro studies demonstrated that varenicline does not inhibit human renal transport proteins at therapeutic concentrations. Therefore, drugs that are cleared by renal secretion (e.g., metformin [see below] ) are unlikely to be affected by varenicline. In vitro studies demonstrated the active renal secretion of varenicline is mediated by the human organic cation transporter OCT2. Co-administration with inhibitors of OCT2 (e.g., cimeditine [see below] ) may not necessitate a dose adjustment of varenicline as the increase in systemic exposure to varenicline is not expected to be clinically meaningful. Furthermore, since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, drugs known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of varenicline [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ; therefore, a dose adjustment of varenicline would not be required. Drug interaction studies were performed with varenicline and digoxin, warfarin, transdermal nicotine, bupropion, cimetidine, and metformin. No clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions have been identified. Metformin When co-administered to 30 smokers, varenicline (1 mg twice daily) did not alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of metformin (500 mg twice daily), which is a substrate of OCT2. Metformin had no effect on varenicline steady-state pharmacokinetics. Cimetidine Co-administration of an OCT2 inhibitor, cimetidine (300 mg four times daily), with varenicline (2 mg single dose) to 12 smokers increased the systemic exposure of varenicline by 29% (90% CI: 21.5%, 36.9%) due to a reduction in varenicline renal clearance. Digoxin Varenicline (1 mg twice daily) did not alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of digoxin administered as a 0.25 mg daily dose in 18 smokers. Warfarin Varenicline (1 mg twice daily) did not alter the pharmacokinetics of a single 25 mg dose of (R, S)-warfarin in 24 smokers. Prothrombin time (INR) was not affected by varenicline. Smoking cessation itself may result in changes to warfarin pharmacokinetics [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Use with Other Drugs for Smoking Cessation Bupropion: Varenicline (1 mg twice daily) did not alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of bupropion (150 mg twice daily) in 46 smokers [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. NRT: Although co-administration of varenicline (1 mg twice daily) and transdermal nicotine (21 mg/day) for up to 12 days did not affect nicotine pharmacokinetics, the incidence of adverse reactions was greater for the combination than for NRT alone [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] ."

Furthermore, since metabolism of varenicline represents less than 10% of its clearance, drugs known to affect the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of varenicline [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ; therefore, a dose adjustment of varenicline would not be required. Drug interaction studies were performed with varenicline and digoxin, warfarin, transdermal nicotine, bupropion, cimetidine, and metformin. No clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions have been identified. Metformin When co-administered to 30 smokers, varenicline (1 mg twice daily) did not alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of metformin (500 mg twice daily), which is a substrate of OCT2. Metformin had no effect on varenicline steady-state pharmacokinetics. Cimetidine Co-administration of an OCT2 inhibitor, cimetidine (300 mg four times daily), with varenicline (2 mg single dose) to 12 smokers increased the systemic exposure of varenicline by 29% (90% CI: 21.5%, 36.9%) due to a reduction in varenicline renal clearance. Digoxin Varenicline (1 mg twice daily) did not alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of digoxin administered as a 0.25 mg daily dose in 18 smokers. Warfarin Varenicline (1 mg twice daily) did not alter the pharmacokinetics of a single 25 mg dose of (R, S)-warfarin in 24 smokers. Prothrombin time (INR) was not affected by varenicline. Smoking cessation itself may result in changes to warfarin pharmacokinetics [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Use with Other Drugs for Smoking Cessation Bupropion: Varenicline (1 mg twice daily) did not alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of bupropion (150 mg twice daily) in 46 smokers [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. NRT: Although co-administration of varenicline (1 mg twice daily) and transdermal nicotine (21 mg/day) for up to 12 days did not affect nicotine pharmacokinetics, the incidence of adverse reactions was greater for the combination than for NRT alone [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] ."

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of varenicline in smoking cessation was demonstrated in six clinical trials in which a total of 3659 chronic cigarette smokers (\u226510 cigarettes per day) were treated with varenicline. In all clinical studies, abstinence from smoking was determined by patient self-report and verified by measurement of exhaled carbon monoxide (CO\u226410 ppm) at weekly visits. Among the varenicline-treated patients enrolled in these studies, the completion rate was 65%. Except for the dose-ranging study (Study 1) and the maintenance of abstinence study (Study 6), patients were treated for 12 weeks and then were followed for 40 weeks post-treatment. Most patients enrolled in these trials were white (79 to 96%). All studies enrolled almost equal numbers of men and women. The average age of patients in these studies was 43 years. Patients on average had smoked about 21 cigarettes per day for an average of approximately 25 years. Patients set a date to stop smoking (target quit date) with dosing starting 1 week before this date. Seven additional studies evaluated the efficacy of varenicline in patients with cardiovascular disease, in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [see Clinical Studies (14.7) ], in patients instructed to select their quit date within days 8 and 35 of treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] , patients with major depressive disorder [see Clinical Studies (14.9) ], patients who had made a previous attempt to quit smoking with varenicline, and either did not succeed in quitting or relapsed after treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.6) ], in patients without or with a history of psychiatric disorder enrolled in a postmarketing neuropsychiatric safety outcome trial [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Clinical Studies (14.10) ] , and in patients who were not able or willing to quit abruptly and were instructed to quit gradually [see Clinical studies (14.5) ] . In all studies, patients were provided with an educational booklet on smoking cessation and received up to 10 minutes of smoking cessation counseling at each weekly treatment visit according to Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality guidelines. 14.1 Initiation of Abstinence Study 1 This was a six-week dose-ranging study comparing varenicline to placebo. This study provided initial evidence that varenicline at a total dose of 1 mg per day or 2 mg per day was effective as an aid to smoking cessation. Study 2 This study of 627 patients compared varenicline 1 mg per day and 2 mg per day with placebo. Patients were treated for 12 weeks (including one-week titration) and then were followed for 40 weeks post-treatment. Varenicline was given in two divided doses daily. Each dose of varenicline was given in two different regimens, with and without initial dose-titration, to explore the effect of different dosing regimens on tolerability. For the titrated groups, dosage was titrated up over the course of one week, with full dosage achieved starting with the second week of dosing. The titrated and nontitrated groups were pooled for efficacy analysis. Forty-five percent of patients receiving varenicline 1 mg per day (0.5 mg twice daily) and 51% of patients receiving 2 mg per day (1 mg twice daily) had CO-confirmed continuous abstinence during weeks 9 through 12 compared to 12% of patients in the placebo group (Figure 1). In addition, 31% of the 1 mg per day group and 31% of the 2 mg per day group were continuously abstinent from one week after TQD through the end of treatment as compared to 8% of the placebo group. Study 3 This flexible-dosing study of 312 patients examined the effect of a patient-directed dosing strategy of varenicline or placebo. After an initial one-week titration to a dose of 0.5 mg twice daily, patients could adjust their dosage as often as they wished between 0.5 mg once daily to 1 mg twice daily per day. Sixty-nine percent of patients titrated to the maximum allowable dose at any time during the study. For 44% of patients, the modal dose selected was 1 mg twice daily; for slightly over half of the study participants, the modal dose selected was 1 mg/day or less. Of the patients treated with varenicline, 40% had CO-confirmed continuous abstinence during weeks 9 through 12 compared to 12% in the placebo group. In addition, 29% of the varenicline group were continuously abstinent from one week after TQD through the end of treatment as compared to 9% of the placebo group. Study 4 and Study 5 These identical double-blind studies compared varenicline 2 mg per day, bupropion sustained-release (SR) 150 mg twice daily, and placebo. Patients were treated for 12 weeks and then were followed for 40 weeks post-treatment. The varenicline dosage of 1 mg twice daily was achieved using a titration of 0.5 mg once daily for the initial 3 days followed by 0.5 mg twice daily for the next 4 days. The bupropion SR dosage of 150 mg twice daily was achieved using a 3-day titration of 150 mg once daily. Study 4 enrolled 1022 patients and Study 5 enrolled 1023 patients. Patients inappropriate for bupropion treatment or patients who had previously used bupropion were excluded. In Study 4, patients treated with varenicline had a superior rate of CO-confirmed abstinence during weeks 9 through 12 (44%) compared to patients treated with bupropion SR (30%) or placebo (17%). The bupropion SR quit rate was also superior to placebo. In addition, 29% of the varenicline group were continuously abstinent from one week after TQD through the end of treatment as compared to 12% of the placebo group and 23% of the bupropion SR group. Similarly in Study 5, patients treated with varenicline had a superior rate of CO-confirmed abstinence during weeks 9 through 12 (44%) compared to patients treated with bupropion SR (30%) or placebo (18%). The bupropion SR quit rate was also superior to placebo. In addition, 29% of the varenicline group were continuously abstinent from one week after TQD through the end of treatment as compared to 11% of the placebo group and 21% of the bupropion SR group.

In each study, varenicline-treated patients were more likely to maintain abstinence throughout the follow-up period than were patients treated with placebo (Figure 2, Table 8). Table 8.

Patients in this study (N=1927) were treated with open-label varenicline 1 mg twice daily for 12 weeks. Patients who had stopped smoking for at least a week by Week 12 (N= 1210) were then randomized to double-blind treatment with varenicline (1 mg twice daily) or placebo for an additional 12 weeks and then followed for 28 weeks post-treatment. The continuous abstinence rate from Week 13 through Week 24 was higher for patients continuing treatment with varenicline (70%) than for patients switching to placebo (50%). Superiority to placebo was also maintained during 28 weeks post-treatment follow-up (varenicline 54% versus placebo 39%). In Figure 3 below, the x-axis represents the study week for each observation, allowing a comparison of groups at similar times after discontinuation of varenicline; post-varenicline follow-up begins at Week 13 for the placebo group and Week 25 for the varenicline group. The y-axis represents the percentage of patients who had been abstinent for the last week of varenicline treatment and remained abstinent at the given timepoint. varenicline-fig2.jpg varenicline-fig3.jpg 14.4 Alternative Instructions for Setting a Quit Date Varenicline was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial where patients were instructed to select a target quit date between Day 8 and Day 35 of treatment. Subjects were randomized 3:1 to varenicline 1 mg twice daily (N=486) or placebo (N=165) for 12 weeks of treatment and followed for another 12 weeks posttreatment. Patients treated with varenicline had a superior rate of CO-confirmed abstinence during weeks 9 through 12 (54%) compared to patients treated with placebo (19%) and from weeks 9 through 24 (35%) compared to subjects treated with placebo (13%). 14.5 Gradual Approach to Quitting Smoking Varenicline was evaluated in a 52-week double-blind placebo-controlled study of 1,510 subjects who were not able or willing to quit smoking within four weeks, but were willing to gradually reduce their smoking over a 12 week period before quitting. Subjects were randomized to either varenicline 1 mg twice daily (N=760) or placebo (N=750) for 24 weeks and followed up post-treatment through week 52. Subjects were instructed to reduce the number of cigarettes smoked by at least 50 percent by the end of the first four weeks of treatment, followed by a further 50 percent reduction from week four to week eight of treatment, with the goal of reaching complete abstinence by 12 weeks. After the initial 12-week reduction phase, subjects continued treatment for another 12 weeks. Subjects treated with varenicline had a significantly higher Continuous Abstinence Rate compared with placebo at weeks 15 through 24 (32% vs. 7%) and weeks 15 through 52 (24% vs. 6%). 14.6 Re-Treatment Study Varenicline was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of patients who had made a previous attempt to quit smoking with varenicline, and either did not succeed in quitting or relapsed after treatment. Subjects were randomized 1:1 to varenicline 1 mg twice daily (N=249) or placebo (N=245) for 12 weeks of treatment and followed for 40 weeks post-treatment. Patients included in this study had taken varenicline for a smoking-cessation attempt in the past (for a total treatment duration of a minimum of two weeks), at least three months prior to study entry, and had been smoking for at least four weeks. Patients treated with varenicline had a superior rate of CO-confirmed abstinence during weeks 9 through 12 (45%) compared to patients treated with placebo (12%) and from weeks 9 through 52 (20%) compared to subjects treated with placebo (3%).

Subjects were randomized to varenicline 1 mg twice daily (N=223) or placebo (N=237) for a treatment of 12 weeks and then were followed for 40 weeks post-treatment. Subjects treated with varenicline had a superior rate of CO-confirmed abstinence during weeks 9 through 12 (41%) compared to subjects treated with placebo (9%) and from week 9 through 52 (19%) compared to subjects treated with placebo (6%).

Subjects were randomized to varenicline 1 mg twice daily (N=353) or placebo (N=350) for a treatment period of 12 weeks and then were followed for 40 weeks post-treatment. Subjects treated with varenicline had a superior rate of CO-confirmed abstinence during weeks 9 through 12 (47%) compared to subjects treated with placebo (14%) and from week 9 through 52 (20%) compared to subjects treated with placebo (7%).

Table 12 below shows mortality and the incidence of selected nonfatal serious CV events occurring more frequently in the varenicline arm compared to the placebo arm. These events were adjudicated by an independent blinded committee. Nonfatal serious CV events not listed occurred at the same incidence or more commonly in the placebo arm. Patients with more than one CV event of the same type are counted only once per row. Some of the patients requiring coronary revascularization underwent the procedure as part of management of nonfatal MI and hospitalization for angina. Table 12.

The study in patients with stable CV disease described above was included in the meta-analysis. There were lower rates of all-cause mortality (varenicline 6 [0.14%]; placebo 7 [0.25%]) and CV mortality (varenicline 2 [0.05%]; placebo 2 [0.07%]) in the varenicline arms compared with the placebo arms in the meta-analysis. The key CV safety analysis included occurrence and timing of a composite endpoint of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE), defined as CV death, nonfatal MI, and nonfatal stroke. These events included in the endpoint were adjudicated by a blinded, independent committee. Overall, a small number of MACE occurred in the trials included in the meta-analysis, as described in Table 13. These events occurred primarily in patients with known CV disease. Table 13. Number of MACE cases, Hazard Ratio and Rate Difference in a Meta-Analysis of 15 Clinical Trials Comparing varenicline to Placebo* V arenicline N=4190 Placebo N=2812 *Includes MACE occurring up to 30 days post-treatment. MACE cases, n (%) 13 (0.31%) 6 (0.21%) Patient-years of exposure 1316 839 Hazard Ratio (95% CI) 1.95 (0.79, 4.82) Rate Difference per 1,000 patient-years (95% CI) 6.30 (-2.40, 15.10) The meta-analysis showed that exposure to varenicline resulted in a hazard ratio for MACE of 1.95 (95% confidence interval from 0.79 to 4.82) for patients up to 30 days after treatment; this is equivalent to an estimated increase of 6.3 MACE events per 1,000 patient-years of exposure. The meta-analysis showed higher rates of CV endpoints in patients on varenicline relative to placebo across different time frames and pre-specified sensitivity analyses, including various study groupings and CV outcomes. Although these findings were not statistically significant they were consistent. Because the number of events was small overall, the power for finding a statistically significant difference in a signal of this magnitude is low. Additionally, a cardiovascular endpoint analysis was added to the postmarketing neuropsychiatric safety outcome study along with a non-treatment extension, [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Studies (14.10) ] . 14.9 Subjects with Major Depressive Disorder Varenicline was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of subjects aged 18 to 75 years with major depressive disorder without psychotic features (DSM-IV TR). If on medication, subjects were to be on a stable antidepressant regimen for at least two months. If not on medication, subjects were to have experienced a major depressive episode in the past 2 years, which was successfully treated. Subjects were randomized to varenicline 1 mg twice daily (N=256) or placebo (N=269) for a treatment of 12 weeks and then followed for 40 weeks post-treatment. Subjects treated with varenicline had a superior rate of CO-confirmed abstinence during weeks 9 through 12 (36%) compared to subjects treated with placebo (16%) and from week 9 through 52 (20%) compared to subjects treated with placebo (10%).

Subjects aged 18-75 years, smoking 10 or more cigarettes per day were randomized 1:1:1:1 to varenicline 1 mg BID, bupropion SR 150 mg BID, NRT patch 21 mg/day with taper or placebo for a treatment period of 12 weeks; they were then followed for another 12 weeks post-treatment. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] A composite safety endpoint intended to capture clinically significant neuropsychiatric (NPS) adverse events included the following NPS adverse events: anxiety, depression, feeling abnormal, hostility, agitation, aggression, delusions, hallucinations, homicidal ideation, mania, panic, paranoia, psychosis, irritability, suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior or completed suicide. As shown in Table 15, the use of varenicline, bupropion, and NRT in the non-psychiatric cohort was not associated with an increased risk of clinically significant NPS adverse events compared with placebo. Similarly, in the non-psychiatric cohort, the use of varenicline was not associated with an increased risk of clinically significant NPS adverse events in the composite safety endpoint compared with bupropion or NRT.

The incidence of events in the composite endpoint was higher for each of the active treatments compared to placebo: Risk Differences (RDs) (95%CI) vs placebo were 2.7% (-0.05, 5.4) for varenicline, 2.2% (-0.5, 4.9) for bupropion, and 0.4% (-2.2, 3.0) for NRT transdermal nicotine.

There were no completed suicides reported in the psychiatric cohort. In both cohorts, subjects treated with varenicline had a superior rate of CO-confirmed abstinence during weeks 9 through 12 and 9 through 24 compared to subjects treated with bupropion, nicotine patch and placebo.

In the parent study (N=8027), subjects aged 18 to 75 years, smoking 10 or more cigarettes per day were randomized 1:1:1:1 to varenicline 1 mg BID, bupropion SR 150 mg BID, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) patch 21 mg/day or placebo for a treatment period of 12 weeks; they were then followed for another 12 weeks post-treatment. The extension study enrolled 4590 (57.2%) of the 8027 subjects who were randomized and treated in the parent study and followed them for additional 28 weeks. Of all treated subjects, 1743 (21.7%) had a medium CV risk and 640 (8.0%) had a high CV risk, as defined by Framingham score. Note that one site from the parent study was excluded in the assessment of CV safety and two sites were excluded in the assessment of neuropsychiatric safety. The primary CV endpoint was the time to major adverse CV event (MACE), defined as CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke during treatment. Deaths and CV events were adjudicated by a blinded, independent committee. Table 18 below shows the incidence of MACE and Hazard Ratios compared to placebo for all randomized subjects exposed to at least 1 partial dose of study treatment in the parent study. Table 18. The Incidence of MACE and Hazard Ratios in the Cardiovascular Safety Assessment Trial in Subjects without or with a History of Psychiatric Disorder Varenicline N=2006 Bupropion N=1997 NRT N=2017 Placebo N=2007 [IR] indicates incidence rate per 1000 person-years * during treatment in the parent neuropsychiatric safety study ** either the end of the extension study or the end of parent neuropsychiatric safety study for those subjects not enrolled into the extension study During treatment* MACE, n [IR] 1 [2.4] 2 [4.9] 1 [2.4] 4 [9.8] Hazard Ratio (95% CI) vs. placebo 0.24 (0.03, 2.18) 0.49 (0.09, 2.69) 0.24 (0.03, 2.18) Through end of study** MACE, n [IR] 3 [2.1] 9 [6.3] 6 [4.3] 8 [5.7] Hazard Ratio (95% CI) vs. placebo 0.36 (0.10, 1.36) 1.09 (0.42, 2.83) 0.74 (0.26, 2.13) For this study, MACE+ was defined as any MACE or a new onset or worsening peripheral vascular disease (PVD) requiring intervention, a need for coronary revascularization, or hospitalization for unstable angina. Incidence rates of MACE+ and all-cause mortality for all randomized subjects exposed to at least 1 partial dose of study treatment in the parent study are shown for all treatment groups during treatment, and through end of study in the Table 19 below. Table 19. The Incidence of MACE+ and All-Cause Death in the Cardiovascular Safety Assessment Trial in Subjects without or with a History of Psychiatric Disorder Varenicline N=2006 Bupropion N=1997 NRT N=2017 Placebo N=2007 [IR] indicates incidence rate per 1000 person-years *during treatment in the parent neuropsychiatric safety study ** either the end of the extension study or the end of the parent neuropsychiatric safety study for those subjects not enrolled into the extension study During treatment * MACE+, n [IR] 5 [12.1] 4 [9.9] 2 [4.8] 5 [12.2] All-cause deaths, n [IR] 0 2 [4.9] 0 2 [4.9] Through end of study ** MACE+, n [IR] 10 [6.9] 15 [10.5] 10 [7.1] 12 [8.6] All-cause deaths, n [IR] 2 [1.4] 4 [2.8] 3 [2.1] 4 [2.9] The number of subjects who experienced MACE, MACE+ and all-cause death was similar or lower among patients treated with varenicline than patients treated with placebo. The number of events observed overall was too low to distinguish meaningful differences between the treatment arms."

        "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION See FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide) Initiate Treatment and Continue to Attempt to Quit if Lapse Instruct patients to set a date to quit smoking and to initiate varenicline tablets treatment one week before the quit date. Alternatively, the patient can begin varenicline tablets dosing and then set a date to quit smoking between days 8 and 35 of treatment. Encourage patients to continue to attempt to quit if they have early lapses after quit day [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. For patients who are sure that they are not able or willing to quit abruptly, a gradual approach to quitting smoking with varenicline tablets may be considered. Patients should begin varenicline tablets dosing and reduce smoking during the first 12 weeks of treatment, then quit by the end of that period and continue treatment for an additional 12 weeks for a total of 24 weeks [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Encourage patients who are motivated to quit and who did not succeed in stopping smoking during prior varenicline tablets therapy for reasons other than intolerability due to adverse events, or who relapsed after treatment to make another attempt with varenicline tablets once factors contributing to the failed attempt have been identified and addressed [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) , Clinical Studies (14.6) ]. How to Take Advise patients that varenicline tablets should be taken orally after eating, and with a full glass of water [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Starting Week Dosage Instruct patients on how to titrate varenicline tablets, beginning at a dose of 0.5 mg/day. Explain that one 0.5 mg tablet should be taken daily for the first three days, and that for the next four days, one 0.5 mg tablet should be taken in the morning and one 0.5 mg tablet should be taken in the evening [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Continuing Weeks Dosage Advise patients that, after the first seven days, the dose should be increased to one 1 mg tablet in the morning and one 1 mg tablet in the evening [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Dosage Adjustment for varenicline tablets or Other Drugs Inform patients that nausea and insomnia are side effects of varenicline tablets and are usually transient; however, advise patients that if they are persistently troubled by these symptoms, they should notify the prescribing physician so that a dose reduction can be considered. Inform patients that some drugs may require dose adjustment after quitting smoking [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Counseling and Support Provide patients with educational materials and necessary counseling to support an attempt at quitting smoking [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events Inform patients that some patients have experienced changes in mood (including depression and mania), psychosis, hallucinations, paranoia, delusions, homicidal ideation, aggression, hostility, agitation, anxiety, and panic, as well as suicidal ideation and suicide when attempting to quit smoking while taking varenicline tablets. Instruct patients to discontinue varenicline tablets and contact a healthcare professional if they experience such symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. History of Psychiatric Illness Encourage patients to reveal any history of psychiatric illness prior to initiating treatment. Nicotine Withdrawal Inform patients that quitting smoking, with or without varenicline tablets, may be associated with nicotine withdrawal symptoms (including depression or agitation) or exacerbation of pre-existing psychiatric illness.

( 7.1 ) Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Combination use increases risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. ( 7.2 ) Warfarin: Combination use increases risk of bleeding. ( 7.3 ) 7.1 CYP2C19 Inhibitors Clopidogrel is metabolized to its active metabolite in part by CYP2C19. Concomitant use of drugs that inhibit the activity of this enzyme results in reduced plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of clopidogrel and a reduction in platelet inhibition. Avoid concomitant use of drugs that inhibit CYP2C19, e.g., omeprazole [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . Omeprazole In a crossover clinical study, 72 healthy subjects were administered Plavix (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg per day) alone and with omeprazole (80 mg at the same time as Plavix) for 5 days. The exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel was decreased by 46% (Day 1) and 42% (Day 5) when Plavix and omeprazole were administered together. Mean inhibition of platelet aggregation was diminished by 47% (24 hours) and 30% (Day 5) when Plavix and omeprazole were administered together. In another study, 72 healthy subjects were given the same doses of Plavix and omeprazole but the drugs were administered 12 hours apart; the results were similar, indicating that administering Plavix and omeprazole at different times does not prevent their interaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 7.2 Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) Coadministration of Plavix and NSAIDs increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. 7.3 Warfarin (CYP2C9 Substrates) Although the administration of clopidogrel 75 mg per day did not modify the pharmacokinetics of S-warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate) or INR in patients receiving long-term warfarin therapy, coadministration of Plavix with warfarin increases the risk of bleeding because of independent effects on hemostasis. However, at high concentrations in vitro , clopidogrel inhibits CYP2C9."

In COMMIT, approximately 58% of the patients treated with Plavix were 60 years and older, 26% of whom were 70 years and older. The observed risk of thrombotic events with clopidogrel plus aspirin versus placebo plus aspirin by age category is provided in Figures 2 and 5 for the CURE and COMMIT trials, respectively [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] .

      "pharmacodynamics": [
        "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clopidogrel must be metabolized by CYP450 enzymes to produce the active metabolite that inhibits platelet aggregation. The active metabolite of clopidogrel selectively inhibits the binding of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to its platelet P2Y 12 receptor and the subsequent ADP-mediated activation of the glycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa complex, thereby inhibiting platelet aggregation. This action is irreversible. Consequently, platelets exposed to clopidogrel's active metabolite are affected for the remainder of their lifespan (about 7 to 10 days). Platelet aggregation induced by agonists other than ADP is also inhibited by blocking the amplification of platelet activation by released ADP. Dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation can be seen 2 hours after single oral doses of Plavix. Repeated doses of 75 mg Plavix per day inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation on the first day, and inhibition reaches steady state between Day 3 and Day 7. At steady state, the average inhibition level observed with a dose of 75 mg Plavix per day was between 40% and 60%. Platelet aggregation and bleeding time gradually return to baseline values after treatment is discontinued, generally in about 5 days. Geriatric Patients Elderly (\u226575 years) and young healthy subjects had similar effects on platelet aggregation. Renally-Impaired Patients After repeated doses of 75 mg Plavix per day, patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance from 5 to 15 mL/min) and moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance from 30 to 60 mL/min) showed low (25%) inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Hepatically-Impaired Patients After repeated doses of 75 mg Plavix per day for 10 days in patients with severe hepatic impairment, inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation was similar to that observed in healthy subjects. Gender In a small study comparing men and women, less inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation was observed in women."

      "description": [
        "11 DESCRIPTION Plavix (clopidogrel bisulfate) is a thienopyridine class inhibitor of P2Y 12 ADP platelet receptors. Chemically it is methyl (+)-( S )-\u03b1-(2-chlorophenyl)-6,7-dihydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine-5(4 H )-acetate sulfate (1:1). The empirical formula of clopidogrel bisulfate is C 16 H 16 ClNO 2 S\u2022H 2 SO 4 and its molecular weight is 419.9. The structural formula is as follows: Clopidogrel bisulfate is a white to off-white powder. It is practically insoluble in water at neutral pH but freely soluble at pH 1. It also dissolves freely in methanol, dissolves sparingly in methylene chloride, and is practically insoluble in ethyl ether. It has a specific optical rotation of about +56\u00b0. Plavix for oral administration is provided as either pink, round, biconvex, debossed, film-coated tablets containing 97.875 mg of clopidogrel bisulfate which is the molar equivalent of 75 mg of clopidogrel base or pink, oblong, debossed film-coated tablets containing 391.5 mg of clopidogrel bisulfate which is the molar equivalent of 300 mg of clopidogrel base. Each tablet contains hydrogenated castor oil, hydroxypropylcellulose, mannitol, microcrystalline cellulose and polyethylene glycol 6000 as inactive ingredients. The pink film coating contains ferric oxide, hypromellose 2910, lactose monohydrate, titanium dioxide and triacetin. The tablets are polished with Carnauba wax. Chemical Structure"

Clopidogrel was not genotoxic in four in vitro tests (Ames test, DNA-repair test in rat hepatocytes, gene mutation assay in Chinese hamster fibroblasts, and metaphase chromosome analysis of human lymphocytes) and in one in vivo test (micronucleus test by oral route in mice). Clopidogrel was found to have no effect on fertility of male and female rats at oral doses up to 400 mg/kg per day (52 times the recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis)."

      "pharmacokinetics": [
        "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Clopidogrel is a prodrug and is metabolized to a pharmacologically active metabolite and inactive metabolites. Absorption After single and repeated oral doses of 75 mg per day, clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed. Absorption is at least 50%, based on urinary excretion of clopidogrel metabolites. Effect of Food Plavix can be administered with or without food. In a study in healthy male subjects when Plavix 75 mg per day was given with a standard breakfast, mean inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation was reduced by less than 9%. The active metabolite AUC 0\u201324 was unchanged in the presence of food, while there was a 57% decrease in active metabolite Cmax. Similar results were observed when a Plavix 300 mg loading dose was administered with a high-fat breakfast. Metabolism Clopidogrel is extensively metabolized by two main metabolic pathways: one mediated by esterases and leading to hydrolysis into an inactive carboxylic acid derivative (85% of circulating metabolites) and one mediated by multiple cytochrome P450 enzymes. Cytochromes first oxidize clopidogrel to a 2-oxo-clopidogrel intermediate metabolite. Subsequent metabolism of the 2-oxo-clopidogrel intermediate metabolite results in formation of the active metabolite, a thiol derivative of clopidogrel. This metabolic pathway is mediated by CYP2C19, CYP3A, CYP2B6 and CYP1A2. The active thiol metabolite binds rapidly and irreversibly to platelet receptors, thus inhibiting platelet aggregation for the lifespan of the platelet. The Cmax of the active metabolite is twice as high following a single 300 mg clopidogrel loading dose as it is after four days of 75 mg maintenance dose. Cmax occurs approximately 30 to 60 minutes after dosing. In the 75 to 300 mg dose range, the pharmacokinetics of the active metabolite deviates from dose proportionality: increasing the dose by a factor of four results in 2.0- and 2.7-fold increases in Cmax and AUC, respectively. Elimination Following an oral dose of 14 C-labeled clopidogrel in humans, approximately 50% of total radioactivity was excreted in urine and approximately 46% in feces over the 5 days post-dosing. After a single, oral dose of 75 mg, clopidogrel has a half-life of approximately 6 hours. The half-life of the active metabolite is about 30 minutes."

( 5.3 ) Recent transient ischemic attack or stroke: Combination use of Plavix and aspirin in these patients was not shown to be more effective than Plavix alone, but was shown to increase major bleeding. ( 5.4 ) Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): TTP has been reported with Plavix, including fatal cases. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Diminished Antiplatelet Activity Due to Impaired CYP2C19 Function Clopidogrel is a prodrug. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by clopidogrel is entirely due to an active metabolite. The metabolism of clopidogrel to its active metabolite can be impaired by genetic variations in CYP2C19 [see Boxed Warning] and by concomitant medications that interfere with CYP2C19. Avoid concomitant use of Plavix and drugs that inhibit CYP2C19 activity. Co-administration of Plavix with omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor that is an inhibitor of CYP2C19, reduces the pharmacological activity of Plavix if given concomitantly or if given 12 hours apart [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 5.2 General Risk of Bleeding Thienopyridines, including Plavix, increase the risk of bleeding. If a patient is to undergo surgery and an antiplatelet effect is not desired, discontinue Plavix 5 days prior to surgery. In patients who stopped therapy more than five days prior to CABG the rates of major bleeding were similar (event rate 4.4% Plavix + aspirin; 5.3% placebo + aspirin). In patients who remained on therapy within five days of CABG, the major bleeding rate was 9.6% for Plavix + aspirin, and 6.3% for placebo + aspirin. Thienopyridines inhibit platelet aggregation for the lifetime of the platelet (7\u201310 days), so withholding a dose will not be useful in managing a bleeding event or the risk of bleeding associated with an invasive procedure. Because the half-life of clopidogrel's active metabolite is short, it may be possible to restore hemostasis by administering exogenous platelets; however, platelet transfusions within 4 hours of the loading dose or 2 hours of the maintenance dose may be less effective. 5.3 Discontinuation of Plavix Avoid lapses in therapy, and if Plavix must be temporarily discontinued, restart as soon as possible. Premature discontinuation of Plavix may increase the risk of cardiovascular events. 5.4 Patients with Recent Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or Stroke In patients with recent TIA or stroke who are at high risk for recurrent ischemic events, the combination of aspirin and Plavix has not been shown to be more effective than Plavix alone, but the combination has been shown to increase major bleeding. 5.5 Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) TTP, sometimes fatal, has been reported following use of Plavix, sometimes after a short exposure (<2 weeks). TTP is a serious condition that requires urgent treatment including plasmapheresis (plasma exchange). It is characterized by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (schistocytes [fragmented RBCs] seen on peripheral smear), neurological findings, renal dysfunction, and fever [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] ."

Initiate aspirin (75\u2013325 mg once daily) and continue in combination with Plavix [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . For patients with STEMI, the recommended dose of Plavix is 75 mg once daily orally, administered in combination with aspirin (75\u2013325 mg once daily), with or without thrombolytics. Plavix may be initiated with or without a loading dose [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . 2.2 Recent MI, Recent Stroke, or Established Peripheral Arterial Disease The recommended daily dose of Plavix is 75 mg once daily orally, with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.3 CYP2C19 Poor Metabolizers CYP2C19 poor metabolizer status is associated with diminished antiplatelet response to clopidogrel. Although a higher dose regimen (600 mg loading dose followed by 150 mg once daily) in poor metabolizers increases antiplatelet response [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] , an appropriate dose regimen for this patient population has not been established in clinical outcome trials."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Bristol-Myers Squibb/Sanofi Pharmaceuticals Partnership at 1-800-633-1610 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions and durations of follow up, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Plavix has been evaluated for safety in more than 54,000 patients, including over 21,000 patients treated for 1 year or more. The clinically important adverse reactions observed in trials comparing Plavix plus aspirin to placebo plus aspirin and trials comparing Plavix alone to aspirin alone are discussed below. Bleeding CURE In CURE, Plavix use with aspirin was associated with an increase in major bleeding (primarily gastrointestinal and at puncture sites) compared to placebo with aspirin (see Table 1). The incidence of intracranial hemorrhage (0.1%) and fatal bleeding (0.2%) were the same in both groups. Other bleeding events that were reported more frequently in the clopidogrel group were epistaxis, hematuria, and bruise. The overall incidence of bleeding is described in Table 1.

The incidence of intracranial hemorrhage was 0.4% for Plavix compared to 0.5% for aspirin. Other bleeding events that were reported more frequently in the Plavix group were epistaxis and hematoma. Other Adverse Events In CURE and CHARISMA, which compared Plavix plus aspirin to aspirin alone, there was no difference in the rate of adverse events (other than bleeding) between Plavix and placebo. In CAPRIE, which compared Plavix to aspirin, pruritus was more frequently reported in those taking Plavix. No other difference in the rate of adverse events (other than bleeding) was reported. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Plavix. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders : Agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia/pancytopenia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) Gastrointestinal disorders: Gastrointestinal and retroperitoneal hemorrhage with fatal outcome, colitis (including ulcerative or lymphocytic colitis), pancreatitis, stomatitis General disorders and administration site condition : Fever, hemorrhage of operative wound Hepato-biliary disorders: Acute liver failure, hepatitis (non-infectious), abnormal liver function test Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylactoid reactions, serum sickness Musculoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders: Musculoskeletal bleeding, myalgia, arthralgia, arthritis Nervous system disorders : Taste disorders, fatal intracranial bleeding Eye disorders : Eye (conjunctival, ocular, retinal) bleeding Psychiatric disorders: Confusion, hallucinations Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: Bronchospasm, interstitial pneumonitis, respiratory tract bleeding Renal and urinary disorders: Glomerulopathy, increased creatinine levels Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Maculopapular or erythematous rash, urticaria, bullous dermatitis, eczema, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, angioedema, erythema multiforme, skin bleeding, lichen planus Vascular disorders: Vasculitis, hypotension"

( 8.3 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B Reproduction studies performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 500 and 300 mg/kg/day, respectively (65 and 78 times the recommended daily human dose, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis), revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or fetotoxicity due to clopidogrel. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of a human response, Plavix should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Studies in rats have shown that clopidogrel and/or its metabolites are excreted in the milk. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from clopidogrel, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in the CAPRIE and CURE controlled clinical studies, approximately 50% of patients treated with Plavix were 65 years of age and older, and 15% were 75 years and older. In COMMIT, approximately 58% of the patients treated with Plavix were 60 years and older, 26% of whom were 70 years and older.

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The clinical evidence of the efficacy of Plavix is derived from three double-blind trials involving 77,599 patients. The CAPRIE study (Clopidogrel vs. Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischemic Events) was a comparison of Plavix to aspirin. The CURE (Clopidogrel in Unstable Angina to Prevent Recurrent Ischemic Events) and the COMMIT/CCS-2 (Clopidogrel and Metoprolol in Myocardial Infarction Trial / Second Chinese Cardiac Study) studies were comparisons of Plavix to placebo, given in combination with aspirin and other standard therapy. The CHARISMA (Clopidogrel for High Atherothrombotic Risk Ischemic Stabilization, Management, and Avoidance) study (n=15,603) also compared Plavix to placebo, given in combination with aspirin and other standard therapy. 14.1 Acute Coronary Syndrome CURE The CURE study included 12,562 patients with ACS without ST-elevation (UA or NSTEMI) and presenting within 24 hours of onset of the most recent episode of chest pain or symptoms consistent with ischemia. Patients were required to have either ECG changes compatible with new ischemia (without ST-elevation) or elevated cardiac enzymes or troponin I or T to at least twice the upper limit of normal. The patient population was largely Caucasian (82%) and included 38% women, and 52% patients \u226565 years of age. Patients were randomized to receive Plavix (300-mg loading dose followed by 75 mg once daily) or placebo, and were treated for up to one year. Patients also received aspirin (75\u2013325 mg once daily) and other standard therapies such as heparin. The use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors was not permitted for three days prior to randomization. The number of patients experiencing the primary outcome (CV death, MI, or stroke) was 582 (9.3%) in the Plavix-treated group and 719 (11.4%) in the placebo-treated group, a 20% relative risk reduction (95% CI of 10%\u201328%; p < 0.001) for the Plavix-treated group (see Table 4 ). Table 4: Outcome Events in the CURE Primary Analysis Outcome Plavix (+ aspirin) Other standard therapies were used as appropriate. Placebo (+ aspirin) Relative Risk Reduction (%) (95% CI) (n=6259) (n=6303) Primary outcome (Cardiovascular death, MI, stroke) 582 (9.3%) 719 (11.4%) 20% (10.3, 27.9) p < 0.001 All Individual Outcome Events: The individual components do not represent a breakdown of the primary and co-primary outcomes, but rather the total number of subjects experiencing an event during the course of the study. CV death 318 (5.1%) 345 (5.5%) 7% (-7.7, 20.6) MI 324 (5.2%) 419 (6.6%) 23% (11.0, 33.4) Stroke 75 (1.2%) 87 (1.4%) 14% (-17.7, 36.6) Most of the benefit of Plavix occurred in the first two months, but the difference from placebo was maintained throughout the course of the trial (up to 12 months) (see Figure 1 ). Figure 1: Cardiovascular Death, Myocardial Infarction, and Stroke in the CURE Study In CURE, the use of Plavix was associated with a lower incidence of CV death, MI or stroke in patient populations with different characteristics, as shown in Figure 2. The benefits associated with Plavix were independent of the use of other acute and long-term cardiovascular therapies, including heparin/LMWH, intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) inhibitors, lipid-lowering drugs, beta-blockers, and ACE-inhibitors. The efficacy of Plavix was observed independently of the dose of aspirin (75\u2013325 mg once daily). The use of oral anticoagulants, non-study anti-platelet drugs, and chronic NSAIDs was not allowed in CURE. Figure 2: Hazard Ratio for Patient Baseline Characteristics and On-Study Concomitant Medications/Interventions for the CURE Study The use of Plavix in CURE was associated with a decrease in the use of thrombolytic therapy (71 patients [1.1%] in the Plavix group, 126 patients [2.0%] in the placebo group; relative risk reduction of 43%), and GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors (369 patients [5.9%] in the Plavix group, 454 patients [7.2%] in the placebo group, relative risk reduction of 18%). The use of Plavix in CURE did not affect the number of patients treated with CABG or PCI (with or without stenting), (2253 patients [36.0%] in the Plavix group, 2324 patients [36.9%] in the placebo group; relative risk reduction of 4.0%). COMMIT In patients with STEMI, the safety and efficacy of Plavix were evaluated in the randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, COMMIT. COMMIT included 45,852 patients presenting within 24 hours of the onset of the symptoms of myocardial infarction with supporting ECG abnormalities ( i.e. , ST-elevation, ST-depression or left bundle-branch block). Patients were randomized to receive Plavix (75 mg once daily) or placebo, in combination with aspirin (162 mg per day), for 28 days or until hospital discharge, whichever came first. The primary endpoints were death from any cause and the first occurrence of re-infarction, stroke or death. The patient population included 28% women, 58% age \u2265 60 years (26% age \u2265 70 years), 55% patients who received thrombolytics, 68% who received ACE-inhibitors, and only 3% who underwent PCI. As shown in Table 5 and Figures 3 and 4 below, Plavix significantly reduced the relative risk of death from any cause by 7% (p=0.029), and the relative risk of the combination of re-infarction, stroke or death by 9% (p=0.002). Table 5: Outcome Events in the COMMIT Analysis Event Plavix (+ aspirin) (N=22961) Placebo (+ aspirin) (N=22891) Odds ratio (95% CI) p-value Composite endpoint: Death, MI, or Stroke The difference between the composite endpoint and the sum of death+non-fatal MI+non-fatal stroke indicates that 9 patients (2 clopidogrel and 7 placebo) suffered both a non-fatal stroke and a non-fatal MI. 2121 (9.2%) 2310 (10.1%) 0.91 (0.86, 0.97) 0.002 Death 1726 (7.5%) 1845 (8.1%) 0.93 (0.87, 0.99) 0.029 Non-fatal MI Non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke exclude patients who died (of any cause). 270 (1.2%) 330 (1.4%) 0.81 (0.69, 0.95) 0.011 Non-fatal Stroke 127 (0.6%) 142 (0.6%) 0.89 (0.70, 1.13) 0.33 Figure 3: Cumulative Event Rates for Death in the COMMIT Study All treated patients received aspirin. Figure 4: Cumulative Event Rates for the Combined End point Re-Infarction, Stroke or Death in the COMMIT Study All treated patients received aspirin. The effect of Plavix did not differ significantly in various pre-specified subgroups as shown in Figure 5. The effect was also similar in non-prespecified subgroups including those based on infarct location, Killip class or prior MI history (see Figure 6). Such subgroup analyses should be interpreted cautiously. Figure 5: Effects of Adding Plavix to Aspirin on the Combined Primary Endpoint across Baseline and Concomitant Medication Subgroups for the COMMIT Study * Three similar-sized prognostic index groups were based on absolute risk of primary composite outcome for each patient calculated from baseline prognostic variables (excluding allocated treatments) with a Cox regression model. Figure 6: Effects of Adding Plavix to Aspirin in the Non-Prespecified Subgroups in the COMMIT Study 14.2 Recent Myocardial Infarction, Recent Stroke, or Established Peripheral Arterial Disease CAPRIE The CAPRIE trial was a 19,185-patient, 304-center, international, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study comparing Plavix (75 mg daily) to aspirin (325 mg daily). The patients randomized had: 1) recent histories of myocardial infarction (within 35 days); 2) recent histories of ischemic stroke (within 6 months) with at least a week of residual neurological signs; or 3) established peripheral arterial disease. Patients received randomized treatment for an average of 1.6 years (maximum of 3 years). The trial's primary outcome was the time to first occurrence of new ischemic stroke (fatal or not), new myocardial infarction (fatal or not), or other vascular death. Deaths not easily attributable to nonvascular causes were all classified as vascular. Table 6: Outcome Events in the CAPRIE Primary Analysis Plavix aspirin Patients n=9599 n=9586 Ischemic stroke (fatal or not) 438 (4.6%) 461 (4.8%) MI (fatal or not) 275 (2.9%) 333 (3.5%) Other vascular death 226 (2.4%) 226 (2.4%) Total 939 (9.8%) 1020 (10.6%) As shown in the table, Plavix was associated with a lower incidence of outcome events, primarily MI. The overall relative risk reduction (9.8% vs. 10.6%) was 8.7%, p=0.045. Similar results were obtained when all-cause mortality and all-cause strokes were counted instead of vascular mortality and ischemic strokes (risk reduction 6.9%). In patients who survived an on-study stroke or myocardial infarction, the incidence of subsequent events was lower in the Plavix group. The curves showing the overall event rate are shown in Figure 7. The event curves separated early and continued to diverge over the 3-year follow-up period. Figure 7: Fatal or Non-Fatal Vascular Events in the CAPRIE Study The statistical significance favoring Plavix over aspirin was marginal (p=0.045). However, because aspirin is itself effective in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with recent myocardial infarction or stroke, the effect of Plavix is substantial. The CAPRIE trial included a population that was randomized on the basis of 3 entry criteria. The efficacy of Plavix relative to aspirin was heterogeneous across these randomized subgroups (p=0.043). It is not clear whether this difference is real or a chance occurrence. Although the CAPRIE trial was not designed to evaluate the relative benefit of Plavix over aspirin in the individual patient subgroups, the benefit appeared to be strongest in patients who were enrolled because of peripheral vascular disease (especially those who also had a history of myocardial infarction) and weaker in stroke patients. In patients who were enrolled in the trial on the sole basis of a recent myocardial infarction, Plavix was not numerically superior to aspirin. 14.3 Lack of Established Benefit of Plavix plus Aspirin in Patients with Multiple Risk Factors or Established Vascular Disease CHARISMA The CHARISMA trial was a 15,603 subject, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study comparing Plavix (75 mg daily) to placebo for prevention of ischemic events in patients with vascular disease or multiple risk factors for atherosclerosis. All subjects were treated with aspirin 75\u2013162 mg daily. The mean duration of treatment was 23 months. The study failed to demonstrate a reduction in the occurrence of the primary endpoint, a composite of CV death, MI, or stroke. A total of 534 (6.9%) patients in the Plavix group versus 573 (7.4%) patients in the placebo group experienced a primary outcome event (p=0.22). Bleeding of all severities was more common in the subjects randomized to Plavix. Figure Figure Figure Figure Figure Figure Figure"

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Clopidogrel is an inhibitor of platelet activation and aggregation through the irreversible binding of its active metabolite to the P2Y 12 class of ADP receptors on platelets. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clopidogrel must be metabolized by CYP450 enzymes to produce the active metabolite that inhibits platelet aggregation. The active metabolite of clopidogrel selectively inhibits the binding of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to its platelet P2Y 12 receptor and the subsequent ADP-mediated activation of the glycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa complex, thereby inhibiting platelet aggregation. This action is irreversible. Consequently, platelets exposed to clopidogrel's active metabolite are affected for the remainder of their lifespan (about 7 to 10 days). Platelet aggregation induced by agonists other than ADP is also inhibited by blocking the amplification of platelet activation by released ADP. Dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation can be seen 2 hours after single oral doses of Plavix. Repeated doses of 75 mg Plavix per day inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation on the first day, and inhibition reaches steady state between Day 3 and Day 7. At steady state, the average inhibition level observed with a dose of 75 mg Plavix per day was between 40% and 60%. Platelet aggregation and bleeding time gradually return to baseline values after treatment is discontinued, generally in about 5 days. Geriatric Patients Elderly (\u226575 years) and young healthy subjects had similar effects on platelet aggregation. Renally-Impaired Patients After repeated doses of 75 mg Plavix per day, patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance from 5 to 15 mL/min) and moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance from 30 to 60 mL/min) showed low (25%) inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Hepatically-Impaired Patients After repeated doses of 75 mg Plavix per day for 10 days in patients with severe hepatic impairment, inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation was similar to that observed in healthy subjects. Gender In a small study comparing men and women, less inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation was observed in women. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Clopidogrel is a prodrug and is metabolized to a pharmacologically active metabolite and inactive metabolites. Absorption After single and repeated oral doses of 75 mg per day, clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed. Absorption is at least 50%, based on urinary excretion of clopidogrel metabolites. Effect of Food Plavix can be administered with or without food. In a study in healthy male subjects when Plavix 75 mg per day was given with a standard breakfast, mean inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation was reduced by less than 9%. The active metabolite AUC 0\u201324 was unchanged in the presence of food, while there was a 57% decrease in active metabolite Cmax. Similar results were observed when a Plavix 300 mg loading dose was administered with a high-fat breakfast. Metabolism Clopidogrel is extensively metabolized by two main metabolic pathways: one mediated by esterases and leading to hydrolysis into an inactive carboxylic acid derivative (85% of circulating metabolites) and one mediated by multiple cytochrome P450 enzymes. Cytochromes first oxidize clopidogrel to a 2-oxo-clopidogrel intermediate metabolite. Subsequent metabolism of the 2-oxo-clopidogrel intermediate metabolite results in formation of the active metabolite, a thiol derivative of clopidogrel. This metabolic pathway is mediated by CYP2C19, CYP3A, CYP2B6 and CYP1A2. The active thiol metabolite binds rapidly and irreversibly to platelet receptors, thus inhibiting platelet aggregation for the lifespan of the platelet. The Cmax of the active metabolite is twice as high following a single 300 mg clopidogrel loading dose as it is after four days of 75 mg maintenance dose. Cmax occurs approximately 30 to 60 minutes after dosing. In the 75 to 300 mg dose range, the pharmacokinetics of the active metabolite deviates from dose proportionality: increasing the dose by a factor of four results in 2.0- and 2.7-fold increases in Cmax and AUC, respectively. Elimination Following an oral dose of 14 C-labeled clopidogrel in humans, approximately 50% of total radioactivity was excreted in urine and approximately 46% in feces over the 5 days post-dosing. After a single, oral dose of 75 mg, clopidogrel has a half-life of approximately 6 hours. The half-life of the active metabolite is about 30 minutes. 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C19 is involved in the formation of both the active metabolite and the 2-oxo-clopidogrel intermediate metabolite. Clopidogrel active metabolite pharmacokinetics and antiplatelet effects, as measured by ex vivo platelet aggregation assays, differ according to CYP2C19 genotype. Genetic variants of other CYP450 enzymes may also affect the formation of clopidogrel's active metabolite. The CYP2C19*1 allele corresponds to fully functional metabolism while the CYP2C19*2 and *3 alleles are nonfunctional. CYP2C19*2 and *3 account for the majority of reduced function alleles in white (85%) and Asian (99%) poor metabolizers. Other alleles associated with absent or reduced metabolism are less frequent, and include, but are not limited to, CYP2C19*4, *5, *6, *7, and *8. A patient with poor metabolizer status will possess two loss-of-function alleles as defined above. Published frequencies for poor CYP2C19 metabolizer genotypes are approximately 2% for whites, 4% for blacks and 14% for Chinese. Tests are available to determine a patient's CYP2C19 genotype. A crossover study in 40 healthy subjects, 10 each in the four CYP2C19 metabolizer groups, evaluated pharmacokinetic and antiplatelet responses using 300 mg followed by 75 mg per day and 600 mg followed by 150 mg per day, each for a total of 5 days. Decreased active metabolite exposure and diminished inhibition of platelet aggregation were observed in the poor metabolizers as compared to the other groups. When poor metabolizers received the 600 mg/150 mg regimen, active metabolite exposure and antiplatelet response were greater than with the 300 mg/75 mg regimen (see Table 3 ). An appropriate dose regimen for this patient population has not been established in clinical outcome trials.

The relationship between CYP2C19 genotype and Plavix treatment outcome was evaluated in retrospective analyses of Plavix-treated subjects in CHARISMA (n=4862) and TRITON-TIMI 38 (n=1477), and in several published cohort studies. In TRITON-TIMI 38 and the majority of the cohort studies, the combined group of patients with either intermediate or poor metabolizer status had a higher rate of cardiovascular events (death, myocardial infarction, and stroke) or stent thrombosis compared to extensive metabolizers. In CHARISMA and one cohort study, the increased event rate was observed only in poor metabolizers."

      "precautions": [
        "PRECAUTIONS: General: Intranasal formulations of desmopressin acetate at high doses and desmopressin acetate injection have infrequently produced a slight elevation of blood pressure which disappears with a reduction of dosage. Although this effect has not been observed when single oral doses up to 0.6 mg have been administered, the drug should be used with caution in patients with coronary artery insufficiency and/or hypertensive cardiovascular disease, because of a possible rise in blood pressure. Desmopressin acetate should be used with caution in patients with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance, such as cystic fibrosis, since these patients may develop hyponatremia. Rare severe allergic reactions have been reported with desmopressin acetate. Anaphylaxis has been reported with intravenous and intranasal administration of desmopressin acetate, but not with desmopressin acetate tablets. Laboratory Tests: Central Diabetes Insipidus: Laboratory tests for monitoring the patient with central diabetes insipidus or post-surgical or head trauma-related polyuria and polydipsia include urine volume and osmolality. In some cases, measurements of plasma osmolality may be useful. Drug Interactions: Although the pressor activity of desmopressin acetate is very low compared to its antidiuretic activity, large doses of desmopressin acetate tablets should be used with other pressor agents only with careful patient monitoring. Carcinogenicity, Mutagenicity, and Impairment of Fertility: Studies with desmopressin acetate have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential or effects on fertility. Pregnancy: Category B: Fertility studies have not been done. Teratology studies in rats and rabbits at doses from 0.05 to 10 \u00b5g/kg/day (approximately 0.1 times the maximum systemic human exposure in rats and up to 38 times the maximum systemic human exposure in rabbits based on surface area, mg/m 2 ) revealed no harm to the fetus due to desmopressin acetate. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Several publications where desmopressin acetate was used in the management of diabetes insipidus during pregnancy are available; these include a few anecdotal reports of congenital anomalies and low birth weight babies. However, no causal connection between these events and desmopressin acetate has been established. A fifteen year Swedish epidemiologic study of the use of desmopressin acetate in pregnant women with diabetes insipidus found the rate of birth defects to be no greater than that in the general population; however, the statistical power of this study is low. As opposed to preparations containing natural hormones, desmopressin acetate in antidiuretic doses has no uterotonic action and the physician will have to weigh the possible therapeutic advantages against the possible risks in each case. Nursing Mothers: There have been no controlled studies in nursing mothers. A single study in postpartum women demonstrated a marked change in plasma, but little if any change in assayable desmopressin acetate in breast milk following an intranasal dose of 0.01 mg. It is not known whether the drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when desmopressin acetate is administered to nursing mothers. Pediatric Use: Central Diabetes Insipidus: Desmopressin acetate tablets have been used safely in pediatric patients, age 4 years and older, with diabetes insipidus for periods up to 44 months. In younger pediatric patients the dose must be individually adjusted in order to prevent an excessive decrease in plasma osmolality leading to hyponatremia and possible convulsions; dosing should start at 0.05 mg (1/2 of the 0.1 mg tablet). Use of desmopressin acetate in pediatric patients requires careful fluid intake restrictions to prevent possible hyponatremia and water intoxication. Primary Nocturnal Enuresis: Desmopressin acetate tablets have been safely used in pediatric patients age 6 years and older with primary nocturnal enuresis for up to 6 months. Some patients respond to a dose of 0.2 mg; however, increasing responses are seen at doses of 0.4 mg and 0.6 mg. No increase in the frequency or severity of adverse reactions or decrease in efficacy was seen with an increased dose or duration. The dose should be individually adjusted to achieve the best results."

      "warnings": [
        "WARNINGS: Very rare cases of hyponatremia have been reported from world-wide postmarketing experience in patients treated with desmopressin acetate. Desmopressin acetate is a potent antidiuretic which, when administered, may lead to water intoxication and/or hyponatremia. Unless properly diagnosed and treated hyponatremia can be fatal. Therefore, fluid restriction is recommended and should be discussed with the patient and/or guardian. Careful medical supervision is required. When desmopressin acetate tablets are administered, in particular in pediatric and geriatric patients, fluid intake should be adjusted downward to decrease the potential occurrence of water intoxication and hyponatremia. (See PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use and Geriatric Use .) All patients receiving desmopressin acetate therapy should be observed for the following signs of symptoms associated with hyponatremia: headache, nausea/vomiting, decreased serum sodium, weight gain, restlessness, fatigue, lethargy, disorientation, depressed reflexes, loss of appetite, irritability, muscle weakness, muscle spasms or cramps and abnormal mental status such as hallucinations, decreased consciousness and confusion. Severe symptoms may include one or a combination of the following: seizure, coma and/or respiratory arrest. Particular attention should be paid to the possibility of the rare occurrence of an extreme decrease in plasma osmolality that may result in seizures which could lead to coma. Desmopressin acetate should be used with caution in patients with habitual or psychogenic polydipsia who may be more likely to drink excessive amounts of water, putting them at greater risk of hyponatremia."

        "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Central Diabetes Insipidus: The dosage of desmopressin acetate tablets must be determined for each individual patient and adjusted according to the diurnal pattern of response. Response should be estimated by two parameters: adequate duration of sleep and adequate, not excessive, water turnover. Patients previously on intranasal desmopressin acetate therapy should begin tablet therapy twelve hours after the last intranasal dose. During the initial dose titration period, patients should be observed closely and appropriate safety parameters measured to assure adequate response. Patients should be monitored at regular intervals during the course of desmopressin acetate tablets therapy to assure adequate antidiuretic response. Modifications in dosage regimen should be implemented as necessary to assure adequate water turnover. Fluid restriction should be observed. (See WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use and Geriatric Use .) Adults and Children: It is recommended that patients be started on doses of 0.05 mg (1/2 of the 0.1 mg tablet) two times a day and individually adjusted to their optimum therapeutic dose. Most patients in clinical trials found that the optimal dosage range is 0.1 mg to 0.8 mg daily, administered in divided doses. Each dose should be separately adjusted for an adequate diurnal rhythm of water turnover. Total daily dosage should be increased or decreased in the range of 0.1 mg to 1.2 mg divided into two or three daily doses as needed to obtain adequate antidiuresis. See Pediatric Use subsection for special considerations when administering desmopressin acetate to pediatric diabetes insipidus patients. Geriatric Use: This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Human Pharmacokinetics , CONTRAINDICATIONS , and PRECAUTIONS , Geriatric Use .) Primary Nocturnal Enuresis: The dosage of desmopressin acetate tablets must be determined for each individual patient and adjusted according to response. Patients previously on intranasal desmopressin acetate therapy can begin tablet therapy the night following (24 hours after) the last intranasal dose. The recommended initial dose for patients age 6 years and older is 0.2 mg at bedtime. The dose may be titrated up to 0.6 mg to achieve the desired response."

        "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Desmopressin acetate tablets contain as active substance, desmopressin acetate, a synthetic analogue of the natural hormone arginine vasopressin. Central Diabetes Insipidus: Dose response studies in patients with diabetes insipidus have demonstrated that oral doses of 0.025 mg to 0.4 mg produced clinically significant antidiuretic effects. In most patients, doses of 0.1 mg to 0.2 mg produced optimal antidiuretic effects lasting up to eight hours. With doses of 0.4 mg, antidiuretic effects were observed for up to 12 hours; measurements beyond 12 hours were not recorded. Increasing oral doses produced dose dependent increases in the plasma levels of desmopressin acetate. The plasma half-life of desmopressin acetate followed a monoexponential time course with t 1/2 values of 1.5 to 2.5 hours which was independent of dose. The bioavailability of desmopressin acetate oral tablets is about 5% compared to intranasal desmopressin acetate, and about 0.16% compared to intravenous desmopressin acetate. The time to reach maximum plasma desmopressin acetate levels ranged from 0.9 to 1.5 hours following oral or intranasal administration, respectively. Following administration of desmopressin acetate tablets, the onset of antidiuretic effect occurs at around 1 hour, and it reaches a maximum at about 4 to 7 hours based on the measurement of increased urine osmolality. The use of desmopressin acetate tablets in patients with an established diagnosis will result in a reduction in urinary output with an accompanying increase in urine osmolality. These effects usually will allow resumption of a more normal life style, with a decrease in urinary frequency and nocturia. There are reports of an occasional change in response to the intranasal formulations of desmopressin acetate (desmopressin acetate Nasal Spray and desmopressin acetate Rhinal Tube). Usually, the change occurred over a period of time greater than six months. This change may be due to decreased responsiveness, or to shortened duration of effect. There is no evidence that this effect is due to the development of binding antibodies, but may be due to a local inactivation of the peptide. No lessening of effect was observed in the 46 patients who were treated with desmopressin acetate tablets for 12 to 44 months and no serum antibodies to desmopressin were detected. The change in structure of arginine vasopressin to desmopressin acetate resulted in less vasopressor activity and decreased action on visceral smooth muscle relative to enhanced antidiuretic activity. Consequently, clinically effective antidiuretic doses are usually below the threshold for effects on vascular or visceral smooth muscle. In the four long-term studies of desmopressin acetate tablets, no increases in blood pressure in 46 patients receiving desmopressin acetate tablets for periods of 12 to 44 months were reported. In one study, the pharmacodynamic characteristics of desmopressin acetate tablets and intranasal formulation were compared during an 8-hour dosing interval at steady state. The doses administered to 36 hydrated (water loaded) healthy male adult volunteers every 8 hours were 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 mg orally and 0.01 mg intranasally by rhinal tube. The results are shown in the following table: Mean Changes from Baseline (SE) in Pharmacodynamic Parameters in Normal Healthy Adult Volunteers (SE) = Standard error of the mean Treatment Total Urine Volume in mL Maximum Urine Osmolality in mOsm/kg 0.1 mg PO q8h -3689.3 (149.6) 514.8 (21.9) 0.2 mg PO q8h -4429.9 (149.6) 686.3 (21.9) 0.4 mg PO q8h -4998.8 (149.6) 769.3 (21.9) 0.01 mg IN q8h -4844.9 (149.6) 754.1 (21.9) With respect to the mean values of total urine volume decrease and maximum urine osmolality increase from baseline, the 90% confidence limits estimated that the 0.4 mg and 0.2 mg oral dose produced between 95% and 110% and 84% to 99% of pharmacodynamic activity, respectively, when compared to the 0.01 mg intranasal dose. While both the 0.2 mg and 0.4 mg oral doses are considered pharmacodynamically similar to the 0.01 mg intranasal dose, the pharmacodynamic data on an inter-subject basis was highly variable and, therefore, individual dosing is recommended. In another study in diabetes insipidus patients, the pharmacodynamic characteristics of desmopressin acetate tablets and intranasal formulations were compared over a 12-hour period. Ten fluid-controlled patients under age 18 were administered tablet doses of 0.2 mg and 0.4 mg, and intranasal doses of 0.01 mg and 0.02 mg. Mean Peak Pharmacodynamic Parameters (SD) in Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes Insipidus Patients (SD) = Standard Deviation Treatment Total Urine Volume in mL/min Maximum Urine Osmolality in mOsm/kg 0.1 mg IN 0.3 (0.15) 717.0 (224.63) 0.2 mg IN 0.3 (0.25) 761.8 (298.82) 0.4 mg PO 0.3 (0.12) 678.3 (147.91) 0.01 mg PO 0.2 (0.15) 787.2 (73.34) All four dose formulations (0.01 mg IN, 0.02 mg IN, 0.2 mg PO and 0.4 mg PO) have a similar, pronounced pharmacodynamic effect on urine volume and urine osmolality. At two hours after study drug administration, mean urine volume was 4 mL/min and urine osmolality was >500 mOsm/kg. Mean plasma osmolality remained relatively constant over the time course recorded (0 to 12 hours). A statistical separation from baseline did not occur at any dose or time point. In these patients, the 0.2 mg tablets and the 0.01 mg intranasal spray exhibited similar pharmacodynamic profiles as did the 0.4 mg tablets and the 0.02 mg intranasal spray formulation. In another study of adult diabetes insipidus patients previously controlled on desmopressin acetate intranasal spray, after one week of self-titration from spray to tablets, patients\u2019 diuresis was controlled with 0.1 mg desmopressin acetate tablets three times a day. Primary Nocturnal Enuresis: Two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies were conducted in 340 patients with primary nocturnal enuresis. Patients were 5-17 years old, and 72% were males. A total of 329 patients were evaluated for efficacy. Patients were evaluated over a two-week baseline period in which the average number of wet nights was 10 (range 4-14). Patients were then randomized to receive 0.2, 0.4, or 0.6 mg of desmopressin acetate or placebo. The pooled results after two weeks are shown in the following table: Response to Desmopressin Acetate and Placebo at Two Weeks of Treatment Mean (SE) Number of Wet Nights/2 Weeks Placebo (n=85) 0.2 mg/day (n=79) 0.4 mg/day (n=82) 0.6 mg/day (n=83) Baseline 10 (0.3) 11 (0.3) 10 (0.3) 10(0.3) Reduction from Baseline 1 (0.3) 3 (0.4) 3 (0.4) 4 (0.4) Percent Reduction from Baseline 10% 27% 30% 40% p-value vs. placebo \u2500 <0.05 <0.05 <0.05 Patients treated with desmopressin acetate tablets showed a statistically significant reduction in the number of wet nights compared to placebo-treated patients. A greater response was observed with increasing doses up to 0.6 mg. In a six month, open-label extension study, patients completing the placebo-controlled studies were started on 0.2 mg/day desmopressin acetate tablets, and the dose was progressively increased until the optimal response was achieved (maximum dose 0.6 mg/day). A total of 230 patients were evaluated for efficacy; the average number of wet nights/2 weeks during the untreated baseline period was 10 (range 4-14), and the average duration (SD) of treatment was 4.2 (1.8) months. Twenty-five (25) patients (11%) achieved a complete or near complete response (\u22642 wet nights/2 weeks) and did not require titration to the 0.6 mg/day dose. The majority of patients (198 of 230, 86%) were titrated to the highest dose. When all dose groups were combined, 128 (56%) showed at least a 50% reduction from baseline in the number of wet nights/2 weeks, while 87 (38%) patients achieved a complete or near complete response."

        "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Trimethoprim is a synthetic antibacterial drug active against a wide variety of aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative ophthalmic pathogens. Trimethoprim blocks the production of tetrahydrofolic acid from dihydrofolic acid by binding to and reversibly inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. This binding is stronger for the bacterial enzyme than for the corresponding mammalian enzyme and therefore selectively interferes with bacterial biosynthesis of nucleic acids and proteins. Polymyxin B, a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic, is bactericidal for a variety of gram-negative organisms, especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It increases the permeability of the bacterial cell membrane by interacting with the phospholipid components of the membrane. Blood samples were obtained from 11 human volunteers at 20 minutes, 1 hour and 3 hours following instillation in the eye of 2 drops of ophthalmic solution containing 1 mg trimethoprim and 10,000 units polymyxin B per mL. Peak serum concentrations were approximately 0.03 mcg/mL trimethoprim and 1 unit/mL polymyxin B. Microbiology In vitro studies have demonstrated that the anti-infective components of trimethoprim sulfate and polymyxin B sulfate ophthalmic solution are active against the following bacterial pathogens that are capable of causing external infections of the eye: Trimethoprim: Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus aegyptius, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis (indole-negative) , Proteus vulgaris (indole-positive) , Enterobacter aerogenes and Serratia marcescens.

        "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antimicrobial preparations, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. Information for Patients Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis: Long-term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential have not been conducted with polymyxin B sulfate or trimethoprim. Mutagenesis: Trimethoprim was demonstrated to be non-mutagenic in the Ames assay. In studies at two laboratories no chromosomal damage was detected in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells at concentrations approximately 500 times human plasma levels after oral administration; at concentrations approximately 1,000 times human plasma levels after oral administration in these same cells, a low level of chromosomal damage was induced at one of the laboratories. Studies to evaluate mutagenic potential have not been conducted with polymyxin B sulfate. Impairment of Fertility: Polymyxin B sulfate has been reported to impair the motility of equine sperm, but its effects on male or female fertility are unknown. No adverse effects on fertility or general reproductive performance were observed in rats given trimethoprim in oral dosages as high as 70 mg/kg/day for males and 14 mg/kg/day for females. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with polymyxin B sulfate. It is not known whether polymyxin B sulfate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Trimethoprim has been shown to be teratogenic in the rat when given in oral doses 40 times the human dose. In some rabbit studies, the overall increase in fetal loss (dead and resorbed and malformed conceptuses) was associated with oral doses 6 times the human therapeutic dose. While there are no large well-controlled studies on the use of trimethoprim in pregnant women, Brumfitt and Pursell, in a retrospective study, reported the outcome of 186 pregnancies during which the mother received either placebo or oral trimethoprim in combination with sulfamethoxazole. The incidence of congenital abnormalities was 4.5% (3 of 66) in those who received placebo and 3.3% (4 of 120) in those receiving trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole. There were no abnormalities in the 10 children whose mothers received the drug during the first trimester. In a separate survey, Brumfitt and Pursell also found no congenital abnormalities in 35 children whose mothers had received oral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole at the time of conception or shortly thereafter. Because trimethoprim may interfere with folic acid metabolism, trimethoprim should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects The oral administration of trimethoprim to rats at a dose of 70 mg/kg/day commencing with the last third of gestation and continuing through parturition and lactation caused no deleterious effects on gestation or pup growth and survival. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when polymyxin B sulfate and trimethoprim ophthalmic solution is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children below the age of 2 months have not been established (see WARNINGS ). Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and other adult patients."

        "DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Withdrawal symptoms, similar in character to those noted with barbiturates and alcohol (convulsions, tremor, abdominal and muscle cramps, vomiting, and sweating), have occurred following abrupt discontinuance of lorazepam. The more severe withdrawal symptoms have usually been limited to those patients who received excessive doses over an extended period of time. Generally milder withdrawal symptoms (e.g., dysphoria and insomnia) have been reported following abrupt discontinuance of benzodiazepines taken continuously at therapeutic levels for several months. Consequently, after extended therapy, abrupt discontinuation should generally be avoided and a gradual dosage-tapering schedule followed. Addiction-prone individuals (such as drug addicts or alcoholics) should be under careful surveillance when receiving lorazepam or other psychotropic agents because of the predisposition of such patients to habituation and dependence. Lorazepam tablets are classified by the Drug Enforcement Administration as a Schedule IV controlled substance."
      ],
      "precautions": [
        "PRECAUTIONS In patients with depression accompanying anxiety, a possibility for suicide should be borne in mind. For elderly or debilitated patients, the initial daily dosage should not exceed 2 mg in order to avoid oversedation. Lorazepam dosage should be terminated gradually, since abrupt withdrawal of any antianxiety agent may result in symptoms similar to those for which patients are being treated: anxiety, agitation, irritability, tension, insomnia, and occasional convulsions. The usual precautions for treating patients with impaired renal or hepatic function should be observed. In patients where gastrointestinal or cardiovascular disorders coexist with anxiety, it should be noted that lorazepam has not been shown to be of significant benefit in treating the gastrointestinal or cardiovascular component. Esophageal dilation occurred in rats treated with lorazepam for more than one year at 6 mg/kg/day. The no-effect dose was 1.25 mg/kg/day (approximately 6 times the maximum human therapeutic dose of 10 mg per day). The effect was reversible only when the treatment was withdrawn within two months of first observation of the phenomenon. The clinical significance of this is unknown. However, use of lorazepam for prolonged periods and in geriatric patients requires caution and there should be frequent monitoring for symptoms of upper G.l. disease. Safety and effectiveness of lorazepam in children of less than 12 years have not been established. INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS To assure the safe and effective use of lorazepam, patients should be informed that, since benzodiazepines may produce psychological and physical dependence, it is advisable that they consult with their physician before either increasing the dose or abruptly discontinuing this drug. ESSENTIAL LABORATORY TESTS Some patients on lorazepam have developed leukopenia, and some have had elevations of LDH. As with other benzodiazepines, periodic blood counts and liver-function tests are recommended for patients on long-term therapy. CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT DRUG INTERACTIONS The benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, produce CNS-depressant effects when administered with such medications as barbiturates or alcohol. CARCINOGENESIS AND MUTAGENESIS No evidence of carcinogenic potential emerged in rats during an 18-month study with lorazepam. No studies regarding mutagenesis have been performed. PREGNANCY Reproductive studies in animals were performed in mice, rats, and two strains of rabbits. Occasional anomalies (reduction of tarsals, tibia, metatarsals, malrotated limbs, gastroschisis, malformed skull, and microphthalmia) were seen in drug-treated rabbits without relationship to dosage. Although all of these anomalies were not present in the concurrent control group, they have been reported to occur randomly in historical controls. At doses of 40 mg/kg and higher, there was evidence of fetal resorption and increased fetal loss in rabbits which was not seen at lower doses. The clinical significance of the above findings is not known. However, an increased risk of congenital malformations associated with the use of minor tranquilizers (chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, and meprobamate) during the first trimester of pregnancy has been suggested in several studies. Because the use of these drugs is rarely a matter of urgency, the use of lorazepam during this period should almost always be avoided. The possibility that a woman of childbearing potential may be pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered. Patients should be advised that if they become pregnant, they should communicate with their physician about the desirability of discontinuing the drug. In humans, blood levels obtained from umbilical cord blood indicate placental transfer of lorazepam and lorazepam glucuronide. NURSING MOTHERS It is not known whether oral lorazepam is excreted in human milk like the other benzodiazepine tranquilizers. As a general rule, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is on a drug since many drugs are excreted in human milk."

        "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Lorazepam is administered orally. For optimal results, dose, frequency of administration, and duration of therapy should be individualized according to patient response. To facilitate this, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, and 2 mg tablets are available. The usual range is 2 to 6 mg/day given in divided doses, the largest dose being taken before bedtime, but the daily dosage may vary from 1 to 10 mg/day. For anxiety, most patients require an initial dose of 2 to 3 mg/day given b.i.d. or t.i.d. For insomnia due to anxiety or transient situational stress, a single daily dose of 2 to 4 mg may be given, usually at bedtime. For elderly or debilitated patients, an initial dosage of 1 to 2 mg/day in divided doses is recommended, to be adjusted as needed and tolerated. The dosage of lorazepam should be increased gradually when needed to help avoid adverse effects. When higher dosage is indicated, the evening dose should be increased before the daytime doses."

      "adverse_reactions": [
        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions, if they occur, are usually observed at the beginning of therapy and generally disappear on continued medication or upon decreasing the dose. In a sample of about 3,500 anxious patients, the most frequent adverse reaction to lorazepam is sedation (15.9%), followed by dizziness (6.9%), weakness (4.2%), and unsteadiness (3.4%). Less frequent adverse reactions are disorientation, depression, nausea, change in appetite, headache, sleep disturbance, agitation, dermatological symptoms, eye-function disturbance, together with various gastrointestinal symptoms and autonomic manifestations. The incidence of sedation and unsteadiness increased with age. Small decreases in blood pressure have been noted but are not clinically significant, probably being related to the relief of anxiety produced by lorazepam. Transient amnesia or memory impairment has been reported in association with the use of benzodiazepines."

        "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Lorazepam is indicated for the management of anxiety disorders or for the short-term relief of the symptoms of anxiety or anxiety associated with depressive symptoms. Anxiety or tension associated with the stress of everyday life usually does not require treatment with an anxiolytic. The effectiveness of lorazepam in long-term use, that is, more than 4 months, has not been assessed by systematic clinical studies. The physician should periodically reassess the usefulness of the drug for the individual patient."
      ],
      "clinical_pharmacology": [
        "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Studies in healthy volunteers show that in single high doses lorazepam has a tranquilizing action on the central nervous system with no appreciable effect on the respiratory or cardiovascular systems. Lorazepam is readily absorbed with an absolute bioavailability of 90 percent. Peak concentrations in plasma occur approximately 2 hours following administration. The peak plasma level of lorazepam from a 2 mg dose is approximately 20 ng/ml. The mean half-life of unconjugated lorazepam in human plasma is about 12 hours and for its major metabolite, lorazepam glucuronide, about 18 hours. At clinically relevant concentrations, lorazepam is approximately 85% bound to plasma proteins. Lorazepam is rapidly conjugated at its 3-hydroxy group into lorazepam glucuronide which is then excreted in the urine. Lorazepam glucuronide has no demonstrable CNS activity in animals. The plasma levels of lorazepam are proportional to the dose given. There is no evidence of accumulation of lorazepam on administration up to six months. Studies comparing young and elderly subjects have shown that the pharmacokinetics of lorazepam remain unaltered with advancing age."

        "OVERDOSAGE In the management of overdosage with any drug, it should be borne in mind that multiple agents may have been taken. Manifestations of lorazepam overdosage include somnolence, confusion, and coma. Induced vomiting and/or gastric lavage should be undertaken, followed by general supportive care, monitoring of vital signs, and close observation of the patient. Hypotension, though unlikely, usually may be controlled with norepinephrine bitartrate injection. The usefulness of dialysis has not been determined. Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, is indicated for the complete or partial reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines and may be used in situations when an overdose with a benzodiazepine is known or suspected. Prior to the administration of flumazenil, necessary measures should be instituted to secure airway, ventilation, and intravenous access. Flumazenil is intended as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for, proper management of benzodiazepine overdose. Patients treated with flumazenil should be monitored for re-sedation, respiratory depression, and other residual benzodiazepine effects for an appropriate period after treatment. The prescriber should be aware of a risk of seizure in association with flumazenil treatment, particularly in long-term benzodiazepine users and in cyclic antidepressant overdose. The complete flumazenil package insert including CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS should be consulted prior to use."

      ],
      "precautions": [
        "PRECAUTIONS Effects Seen with Anticholinergic Drugs: Ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic hyperplasia, or bladder neck obstruction, particularly if they are receiving an anticholinergic by another route. Use in Hepatic or Renal Disease: Ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency. It should be used with caution in those patient populations. Patients should be advised that temporary blurring of vision, precipitation or worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma, mydriasis, increased intraocular pressure, acute eye pain or discomfort, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival and corneal congestion may result if ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) comes into direct contact with the eyes. Patients should be instructed to avoid spraying ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) in or around the eyes. Patients who experience eye pain, blurred vision, excessive nasal dryness or episodes of nasal bleeding should be instructed to contact their doctor. To ensure proper dosing, patients should be advised not to alter the size of the nasal spray opening. Patients should be reminded to carefully read and follow the accompanying Patient's Instructions for Use . Since dizziness, accommodation disorder, mydriasis, and blurred vision may occur with use of ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray), patients should be cautioned about engaging in activities requiring balance and visual acuity such as driving a car or operating appliances, machinery, etc. No controlled clinical trials were conducted to investigate drug-drug interactions. There is potential for an additive interaction with other concomitantly administered medications with anticholinergic properties, including ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) for oral inhalation. Two-year oral carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice have revealed no carcinogenic activity at doses up to 6 mg/kg. This dose corresponds in rats and mice to approximately 70 and 35 times the maximum recommended daily intranasal dose in adults, respectively, and approximately 35 and 15 times the maximum recommended daily intranasal dose in children, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis. Results of various mutagenicity studies (Ames test, mouse dominant lethal test, mouse micronucleus test, and chromosome aberration of bone marrow in Chinese hamsters) were negative. Fertility of male or female rats at oral doses up to 50 mg/kg (approximately 600 times the maximum recommended daily intranasal dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis) was unaffected by ipratropium bromide administration. At an oral dose of 500 mg/kg (approximately 16,000 times the maximum recommended daily intranasal dose in adults on a mg/m 2 basis), ipratropium bromide produced a decrease in the conception rate. Pregnancy Category B. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies for ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Oral reproduction studies were performed at ipratropium doses of 10 mg/kg in mice, 1,000 mg/kg in rats and 125 mg/kg in rabbits. These doses correspond, in each species respectively, to approximately 60, 12,000, and 3,000 times the maximum recommended daily intranasal dose (MRDID) in adults on a mg/m 2 basis. Inhalation reproduction studies were conducted in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.5 and 1.8 mg/kg, respectively (approximately 20 and 45 times, respectively, the MRDID in adults on a mg/m 2 basis). These studies demonstrated no evidence of teratogenic effects as a result of ipratropium bromide. At oral doses above 90 mg/kg in rats (approximately 1,100 times the MRDID in adults on a mg/m 2 basis) embryotoxicity was observed as increased resorption. This effect is not considered relevant to human use due to the large doses at which it was observed and the difference in route of administration. The effect of ipratropium bromide on labor and delivery is unknown. It is known that some ipratropium bromide is systemically absorbed following nasal administration; however the portion which may be excreted in human milk is unknown. Because lipid-insoluble quaternary cations pass into breast milk, caution should be exercised when ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) is administered to a nursing mother. The safety of ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) at a dose of two sprays (84 mcg) per nostril three times a day (total dose 504 mcg/day) for two to four days has been demonstrated in two clinical trials involving 362 pediatric patients 5-11 years of age with naturally acquired common colds. In this pediatric population ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) had an adverse event profile similar to that observed in adolescent and adult patients. When ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) was concomitantly administered with an oral decongestant (pseudoephedrine HCl) in 122 children ages 5-12 years, and concomitantly administered with an oral decongestant/antihistamine combination (pseudoephedrine HCl/chlorpheniramine maleate) in 123 children ages 5-12 years, adverse event profiles were similar to ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) alone. The safety of ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) at a dose of two sprays (84 mcg) per nostril four times a day (total dose 672 mcg/day) for three weeks in pediatric seasonal allergic rhinitis patients down to 5 years is based upon the safety demonstrated in the pediatric common cold trials and the trial in adult and adolescent patients 12 to 75 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis. The effectiveness of ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) for the treatment of rhinorrhea associated with the common cold and seasonal allergic rhinitis in this pediatric age group is based on extrapolation of the demonstrated efficacy of ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) in adolescents and adults with the conditions and the likelihood that the disease course, pathophysiology, and the drug\u2019s effects are substantially similar to that of adults. The recommended dose for common cold for the pediatric population is based on cross-study comparisons of the efficacy of ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) in adult and pediatric patients and on its safety profile in both adults and pediatric common cold patients. The recommended dose for seasonal allergic rhinitis for the pediatric population down to 5 years is based upon the efficacy and safety of ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and above with seasonal allergic rhinitis and the safety profile of this dose in both adult and pediatric common cold patients. The safety and effectiveness of ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) in pediatric patients under 5 years of age have not been established."

Table 1 shows adverse events reported for patients who received ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) at the recommended dose of 84 mcg per nostril, or vehicle, administered three or four times daily, where the incidence is 1% or greater in the ipratropium bromide group and higher in the ipratropium bromide group than in the vehicle group. Table 1 % of Patients with Common Cold Reporting Events * Ipratropium Bromide Nasal Solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) Vehicle Control No. of Patients 352 351 Epistaxis \u2020 8.2% 2.3% Nasal Dryness 4.8% 2.8% Dry Mouth/Throat 1.4% 0.3% Nasal Congestion 1.1% 0.0% This table includes adverse events for which the incidence was 1% or greater in the ipratropium bromide group and higher in the ipratropium bromide group than in the vehicle group. Epistaxis reported by 5.4% of ipratropium bromide patients and 1.4% of vehicle patients, blood-tinged nasal mucus by 2.8% of ipratropium bromide patients and 0.9% of vehicle patients. Ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) was well tolerated by most patients. The most frequently reported adverse events were transient episodes of nasal dryness or epistaxis. The majority of these adverse events (96%) were mild or moderate in nature, none was considered serious, and none resulted in hospitalization. No patient required treatment for nasal dryness, and only three patients (<1%) required treatment for epistaxis, which consisted of local application of pressure or a moisturizing agent (e.g., petroleum jelly). No patient receiving ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) was discontinued from the trial due to either nasal dryness or bleeding. Adverse events reported by less than 1% of the patients receiving ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) during the controlled clinical trials that are potentially related to ipratropium bromide\u2019s local effects or systemic anticholinergic effects include: taste perversion, nasal burning, conjunctivitis, coughing, dizziness, hoarseness, palpitation, pharyngitis, tachycardia, thirst, tinnitus and blurred vision. No controlled trial was conducted to address the relative incidence of adverse events for three times daily versus four times daily therapy. Nasal adverse events seen in the clinical trial with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) patients (see Table 2) were similar to those seen in the common cold trials. Additional events were reported at a higher rate in the SAR trial due in part to the longer duration of the trial and the inclusion of Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URI) as an adverse event. In common cold trials, URI was the disease under study and not an adverse event.

In order to ensure proper dosing, do not attempt to change the size of the spray opening. Ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) is indicated for the symptomatic relief of rhinorrhea (runny nose) associated with the common cold or seasonal allergic rhinitis for adults and children age 5 years and older. Ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) does not relieve nasal congestion or sneezing associated with the common cold or seasonal allergic rhinitis. Do not use ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) for longer than four days for a common cold or three weeks for seasonal allergic rhinitis unless instructed by your physician. Read complete instructions carefully and use only as directed. To Use: 1. Remove the clear plastic dust cap and the safety clip from the nasal spray pump (Figure 1). The safety clip prevents the accidental discharge of the spray in your pocket or purse. 2. The nasal spray pump must be primed before ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) is used for the first time. To prime the pump, hold the bottle with your thumb at the base and your index and middle fingers on the white shoulder area. Make sure the bottle points upright and away from your eyes. Press your thumb firmly and quickly against the bottle seven times (Figure 2). The pump is now primed and can be used. Your pump should not have to be reprimed unless you have not used the medication for more than 24 hours; repriming the pump will only require two sprays. If you have not used your nasal spray for more than seven days, repriming the pump will require seven sprays. 3. Before using ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray), blow your nose gently to clear your nostrils if necessary. 4. Close one nostril by gently placing your finger against the side of your nose, tilt your head slightly forward and, keeping the bottle upright, insert the nasal tip into the other nostril (Figure 3). Point the tip toward the back and outer side of the nose. 5. Press firmly and quickly upwards with the thumb at the base while holding the white shoulder portion of the pump between your index and middle fingers. Following each spray, sniff deeply and breathe out through your mouth. 6. After spraying the nostril and removing the unit, tilt your head backwards for a few seconds to let the spray spread over the back of the nose. 7. Repeat steps 4 through 6 in the same nostril. 8. Repeat steps 4 through 7 in the other nostril (i.e., two sprays per nostril). 9. Replace the clear plastic dust cap and safety clip. 10. At some time before the medication is completely used up, you should consult your physician or pharmacist to determine whether a refill is needed. You should not take extra doses or stop using ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) without consulting your physician. To Clean: If the nasal tip becomes clogged, remove the clear plastic dust cap and safety clip. Hold the nasal tip under running, warm tap water (Figure 4) for about a minute. Dry the nasal tip, reprime the nasal spray pump (step 2 above), and replace the plastic dust cap and safety clip. Caution: Ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) is intended to relieve your rhinorrhea (runny nose) with regular use. It is therefore important that you use ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) as prescribed by your physician. For most patients, some improvement in runny nose is apparent following the first dose of treatment with ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray). Do not use ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) for longer than four days for your cold or three weeks for seasonal allergic rhinitis unless instructed by your physician. Do not spray ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) in your eyes. Should this occur, immediately flush your eye with cool tap water for several minutes. If you accidentally spray ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) in your eyes, you may experience a temporary blurring of vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival and corneal congestion, development or worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma, pupil dilation, or acute eye pain/discomfort, and increased sensitivity to light which may last a few hours. Should acute eye pain or blurred vision occur, contact your doctor. Should you experience excessive nasal dryness or episodes of nasal bleeding contact your doctor. If you have glaucoma or difficulty urinating due to an enlargement of the prostate, be sure to tell your physician prior to using ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray).

      "clinical_pharmacology": [
        "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Ipratropium bromide is an anticholinergic (parasympatholytic) agent which, based on animal studies, appears to inhibit vagally-mediated reflexes by antagonizing the action of acetylcholine, the transmitter agent released at the neuromuscular junctions in the lung. In humans, ipratropium bromide has anti-secretory properties and, when applied locally, inhibits secretions from the serous and seromucous glands lining the nasal mucosa. Ipratropium bromide is a quaternary amine that minimally crosses the nasal and gastrointestinal membranes and the blood-brain barrier, resulting in a reduction of the systemic anticholinergic effects (e.g., neurologic, ophthalmic, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal effects) that are seen with tertiary anticholinergic amines. Absorption: Ipratropium bromide is poorly absorbed into the systemic circulation following oral administration (2-3%). Less than 20% of an 84 mcg per nostril dose was absorbed from the nasal mucosa of normal volunteers, induced-cold adult volunteers, naturally acquired common cold pediatric patients, or perennial rhinitis adult patients. Distribution: Ipratropium bromide is minimally bound (0 to 9% in vitro ) to plasma albumin and \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein. Its blood/plasma concentration ratio was estimated to be about 0.89. Studies in rats have shown that ipratropium bromide does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Metabolism: Ipratropium bromide is partially metabolized to ester hydrolysis products, tropic acid, and tropane. These metabolites appear to be inactive based on in vitro receptor affinity studies using rat brain tissue homogenates. Elimination: After intravenous administration of 2 mg ipratropium bromide to 10 healthy volunteers, the terminal half-life of ipratropium bromide was approximately 1.6 hours. The total body clearance and renal clearance were estimated to be 2,505 and 1,019 mL/min, respectively. The amount of the total dose excreted unchanged in the urine (Ae) within 24 hours was approximately one-half of the administered dose. Pediatrics: Following administration of 84 mcg of ipratropium bromide per nostril three times a day in patients 5-18 years old (n=42) with a naturally acquired common cold, the mean amount of the total dose excreted unchanged in the urine of 7.8% was comparable to 84 mcg per nostril four times a day in an adult induced common cold population (n=22) of 7.3 to 8.1%. Plasma ipratropium concentrations were relatively low (ranging from undetectable up to 0.62 ng/mL). No correlation of the amount of the total dose excreted unchanged in the urine (Ae) with age or gender was observed in the pediatric population. Special Populations: Gender does not appear to influence the absorption or excretion of nasally administered ipratropium bromide. The pharmacokinetics of ipratropium bromide have not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency or in the elderly. Drug-Drug Interactions: No specific pharmacokinetic studies were conducted to evaluate potential drug-drug interactions. Pharmacodynamics In two single dose trials (n=17), doses up to 336 mcg of ipratropium bromide did not significantly affect pupillary diameter, heart rate, or systolic/diastolic blood pressure. Similarly, ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) in adult patients (n=22) with induced-colds, (84 mcg/nostril four times a day) and in pediatric patients (n=45) with naturally acquired common cold (84 mcg/nostril three times a day) had no significant effects on pupillary diameter, heart rate, or systolic/diastolic blood pressure. Controlled clinical trials demonstrated that intranasal fluorocarbon-propelled ipratropium bromide does not alter physiologic nasal functions (e.g., sense of smell, ciliary beat frequency, mucociliary clearance, or the air conditioning capacity of the nose). The clinical trials for ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) were conducted in patients with rhinorrhea associated with naturally occurring common colds. In two controlled four day comparisons of ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) (84 mcg per nostril, administered three or four times daily; n=352) with its vehicle (n=351), there was a statistically significant reduction of rhinorrhea, as measured by both nasal discharge weight and the patients\u2019 subjective assessment of severity of rhinorrhea using a visual analog scale. These significant differences were evident within one hour following dosing. There was no effect of ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) on degree of nasal congestion or sneezing. The response to ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) did not appear to be affected by age or gender. No controlled clinical trials directly compared the efficacy of three times daily versus four times daily treatment. One clinical trial was conducted with ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray), administered four times daily for three weeks, in 218 patients with rhinorrhea associated with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis (SAR), compared to its vehicle in 211 patients. Patients in this trial were adults and adolescents 12 years of age and above. Ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) was significantly more effective in reducing the severity and duration of rhinorrhea over the three weeks of the study, as measured by daily patient symptom scores. There was no difference between treatment groups in the effect on nasal congestion, sneezing or itching eyes."

      "precautions": [
        "PRECAUTIONS General Review of experience to date suggests that a subgroup of older patients with associated severe illness may tolerate diarrhea less well. When clindamycin is indicated in these patients, they should be carefully monitored for change in bowel frequency. Clindamycin phosphate should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis. Clindamycin phosphate should be prescribed with caution in atopic individuals. Certain infections may require incision and drainage or other indicated surgical procedures in addition to antibiotic therapy. The use of clindamycin phosphate may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms\u2212 particularly yeasts. Should superinfections occur, appropriate measures should be taken as indicated by the clinical situation. Clindamycin phosphate should not be injected intravenously undiluted as a bolus, but should be infused over at least 10-60 minutes as directed in the DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section. Clindamycin dosage modification may not be necessary in patients with renal disease. In patients with moderate to severe liver disease, prolongation of clindamycin half-life has been found. However, it was postulated from studies that when given every eight hours, accumulation should rarely occur. Therefore, dosage modification in patients with liver disease may not be necessary. However, periodic liver enzyme determinations should be made when treating patients with severe liver disease. Prescribing clindamycin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including clindamycin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When clindamycin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by clindamycin or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Laboratory Tests During prolonged therapy periodic liver and kidney function tests and blood counts should be performed. Drug Interactions Clindamycin has been shown to have neuromuscular blocking properties that may enhance the action of other neuromuscular blocking agents. Therefore, it should be used with caution in patients receiving such agents. Antagonism has been demonstrated between clindamycin and erythromycin in vitro . Because of possible clinical significance, the two drugs should not be administered concurrently. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long term studies in animals have not been performed with clindamycin to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Genotoxicity tests performed included a rat micronucleus test and an Ames Salmonella reversion test. Both tests were negative. Fertility studies in rats treated orally with up to 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.1 times the highest recommended adult human dose based on mg/m 2 ) revealed no effects on fertility or mating ability. Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category B Reproduction studies performed in rats and mice using oral doses of clindamycin up to 600 mg/kg/day (2.1 and 1.1 times the highest recommended adult human dose based on mg/m 2 , respectively) or subcutaneous doses of clindamycin up to 250 mg/kg/day (0.9 and 0.5 times the highest recommended adult human dose based on mg/m 2 , respectively) revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of the human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if it is clearly needed. Nursing Mothers Clindamycin has been reported to appear in breast milk in the range of 0.7 to 3.8 mcg/mL at dosages of 150 mg orally to 600 mg intravenously. Because of the potential for adverse reactions due to clindamycin in neonates (see Pediatric Use ), the decision to discontinue the drug should be made, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use When clindamycin phosphate injection is administered to the pediatric population (birth to 16 years) appropriate monitoring of organ system functions is desirable. Usage in Newborns and Infants This product contains benzyl alcohol as a preservative. Benzyl alcohol has been associated with a fatal \u201cGasping Syndrome\u201d in premature infants. The potential for the toxic effect in the pediatric population from chemicals that may leach from the single dose premixed IV preparation in plastic has not been evaluated. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of clindamycin did not include sufficient numbers of patients age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. However, other reported clinical experience indicates that antibiotic-associated colitis and diarrhea (due to Clostridium difficile ) seen in association with most antibiotics occur more frequently in the elderly (>60 years) and may be more severe. These patients should be carefully monitored for the development of diarrhea. Pharmacokinetic studies with clindamycin have shown no clinically important differences between young and elderly subjects with normal hepatic function and normal (age-adjusted) renal function after oral or intravenous administration."

        "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Clindamycin Injection, USP is indicated in the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria. Clindamycin Injection, USP is also indicated in the treatment of serious infections due to susceptible strains of streptococci, pneumococci, and staphylococci. Its use should be reserved for penicillin-allergic patients or other patients for whom, in the judgment of the physician, a penicillin is inappropriate. Because of the risk of antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis, as described in the WARNING box, before selecting clindamycin the physician should consider the nature of the infection and the suitability of less toxic alternatives (e.g., erythromycin). Bacteriologic studies should be performed to determine the causative organisms and their susceptibility to clindamycin. Indicated surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy. Clindamycin Injection, USP is indicated in the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated organisms in the conditions listed below: Lower respiratory tract infections including pneumonia, empyema, and lung abscess caused by anaerobes, Streptococcus pneumoniae , other streptococci (except E. faecalis ), and Staphylococcus aureus . Skin and skin structure infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes , Staphylococcus aureus , and anaerobes. Gynecological infections including endometritis, nongonococcal tubo-ovarian abscess, pelvic cellulitis, and postsurgical vaginal cuff infection caused by susceptible anaerobes. Intra-abdominal infections including peritonitis and intra-abdominal abscess caused by susceptible anaerobic organisms. Septicemia caused by Staphylococcus aureus , streptococci (except Enterococcus faecalis ), and susceptible anaerobes. Bone and joint infections including acute hematogenous osteomyelitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus and as adjunctive therapy in the surgical treatment of chronic bone and joint infections due to susceptible organisms. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of clindamycin and other antibacterial drugs, clindamycin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including clindamycin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. A careful inquiry should be made concerning previous sensitivities to drugs and other allergens. This product contains benzyl alcohol as a preservative. Benzyl alcohol has been associated with a fatal \u201cGasping Syndrome\u201d in premature infants. (See PRECAUTIONS \u2212 Pediatric Use ).

        "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION If diarrhea occurs during therapy, this antibiotic should be discontinued. (See WARNING box). Adults: Parenteral (I.M. or I.V. Administration): Serious infections due to aerobic gram-positive cocci and the more susceptible anaerobes (NOT generally including Bacteroides fragilis , Peptococcus species and Clostridium species other than Clostridium perfringens ): 600 to 1200 mg/day in 2, 3 or 4 equal doses. More severe infections, particularly those due to proven or suspected Bacteroides fragilis , Peptococcus species, or Clostridium species other than Clostridium perfringens : 1200 to 2700 mg/day in 2, 3 or 4 equal doses. For more serious infections, these doses may have to be increased. In life-threatening situations due to either aerobes or anaerobes, these doses may be increased. Doses of as much as 4800 mg daily have been given intravenously to adults. See Dilution and Infusion Rates section below. Single I.M. injections of greater than 600 mg are not recommended. Alternatively, drug may be administered in the form of a single rapid infusion of the first dose followed by continuous I.V. infusion as follows: To maintain serum clindamycin levels Above 4 mcg/mL Above 5 mcg/mL Above 6 mcg/mL Rapid infusion rate 10 mg/min for 30 min 15 mg/min for 30 min 20 mg/min for 30 min Maintenance infusion rate 0.75 mg/min 1 mg/min 1.25 mg/min Neonates (less than 1 month): 15 to 20 mg/kg/day in three to four equal doses. The lower dosage may be adequate for small prematures. Pediatric patients (1 month of age to 16 years): Parenteral (I.M. or I.V.) administration: 20 to 40 mg/kg/day in 3 or 4 equal doses. The higher doses would be used for more severe infections. As an alternative to dosing on a body weight basis, pediatric patients may be dosed on the basis of square meters body surface: 350 mg/m 2 /day for serious infections and 450 mg/m 2 /day for more severe infections. Parenteral therapy may be changed to clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride for oral solution or clindamycin hydrochloride capsules when the condition warrants and at the discretion of the physician. In cases of \u03b2-hemolytic streptococcal infections, treatment should be continued for at least 10 days. Dilution and Infusion Rates: Clindamycin phosphate must be diluted prior to I.V. administration. The concentration of clindamycin in diluent for infusion should not exceed 18 mg per mL. Infusion rates should not exceed 30 mg per minute. The usual infusion dilutions and rates are as follows: Dose Diluent Time 300 mg 600 mg 900 mg 1200 mg 50 mL 50 mL 50-100 mL 100 mL 10 min 20 min 30 min 40 min Administration of more than 1200 mg in a single 1-hour infusion is not recommended. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Dilution and Compatibility: Physical and biological compatibility studies monitored for 24 hours at room temperature have demonstrated no inactivation or incompatibility with the use of clindamycin phosphate in I.V. solutions containing sodium chloride, glucose, calcium or potassium, and solutions containing vitamin B complex in concentrations usually used clinically. No incompatibility has been demonstrated with the antibiotics cephalothin, kanamycin, gentamicin, penicillin or carbenicillin. The following drugs are physically incompatible with clindamycin phosphate: ampicillin sodium, phenytoin sodium, barbiturates, aminophylline, calcium gluconate, and magnesium sulfate. The compatibility and duration of stability of drug admixtures will vary depending on concentration and other conditions. Physico-Chemical Stability of Diluted Solutions of Clindamycin: Room temperature: 6, 9, and 12 mg/mL (equivalent to clindamycin base) in 5% Dextrose Injection, 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, or Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection in glass bottles or minibags, demonstrated physical and chemical stability for at least 16 days at 25\u00b0C. Also, 18 mg/mL (equivalent to clindamycin base) in 5% Dextrose Injection, in minibags, demonstrated physical and chemical stability for at least 16 days at 25\u00b0C. Refrigeration: 6, 9 and 12 mg/mL (equivalent to clindamycin base) in 5% Dextrose Injection, 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, or Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection in glass bottles or minibags, demonstrated physical and chemical stability for at least 32 days at 4\u00b0C. IMPORTANT: This chemical stability information in no way indicates that it would be acceptable practice to use this product well after the preparation time. Good professional practice suggests that compounded admixtures should be administered as soon after preparation as is feasible. Frozen: 6, 9 and 12 mg/mL (equivalent to clindamycin base) in 5% Dextrose Injection, 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, or Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection in minibags demonstrated physical and chemical stability for at least eight weeks at -10\u00b0C. Frozen solutions should be thawed at room temperature and not refrozen. Caution: Do not use plastic containers in series connections. Such use could result in air embolism due to residual air being drawn from the primary container before administration of the fluid from the secondary container is complete."

Gastrointestinal: Antibiotic-associated colitis (see WARNINGS ), pseudomembranous colitis abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. The onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibacterial treatment (see WARNINGS ). An unpleasant or metallic taste occasionally has been reported after intravenous administration of the higher doses of clindamycin phosphate. Hypersensitivity Reactions: Maculopapular rash and urticaria have been observed during drug therapy. Generalized mild to moderate morbilliform-like skin rashes are the most frequently reported of all adverse reactions. Rare instances of erythema multiforme, some resembling Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been associated with clindamycin. A few cases of anaphylactoid reactions have been reported. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued. The usual agents (epinephrine, corticosteroids, antihistamines) should be available for emergency treatment of serious reactions. Skin and Mucous Membranes: Pruritus, vaginitis, and rare instances of exfoliative dermatitis have been reported. (See Hypersensitivity Reactions ). Liver: Jaundice and abnormalities in liver function tests have been observed during clindamycin therapy. Renal: Although no direct relationship of clindamycin to renal damage has been established, renal dysfunction as evidenced by azotemia, oliguria, and/or proteinuria has been observed in rare instances. Hematopoietic: Transient neutropenia (leukopenia) and eosinophilia have been reported. Reports of agranulocytosis and thrombocytopenia have been made. No direct etiologic relationship to concurrent clindamycin therapy could be made in any of the foregoing. Local Reactions: Pain, induration and sterile abscess have been reported after intramuscular injection and thrombophlebitis after intravenous infusion. Reactions can be minimized or avoided by giving deep intramuscular injections and avoiding prolonged use of indwelling intravenous catheters. Musculoskeletal: Rare instances of polyarthritis have been reported. Cardiovascular: Rare instances of cardiopulmonary arrest and hypotension have been reported following too rapid intravenous administration. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

        "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Biologically inactive clindamycin phosphate is rapidly converted to active clindamycin. By the end of short-term intravenous infusion, peak serum levels of active clindamycin are reached. Biologically inactive clindamycin phosphate disappears rapidly from the serum; the average elimination half-life is 6 minutes; however, the serum elimination half-life of active clindamycin is about 3 hours in adults and 2\u00bd hours in pediatric patients. After intramuscular injection of clindamycin phosphate, peak levels of active clindamycin are reached within 3 hours in adults and 1 hour in pediatric patients. Serum level curves may be constructed from I.V. peak serum levels as given in Table 1 by application of elimination half-lives listed above. Serum levels of clindamycin can be maintained above the in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations for most indicated organisms by administration of clindamycin phosphate every 8 to 12 hours in adults and every 6 to 8 hours in pediatric patients, or by continuous intravenous infusion. An equilibrium state is reached by the third dose. The elimination half-life of clindamycin is increased slightly in patients with markedly reduced renal or hepatic function. Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are not effective in removing clindamycin from the serum. Dosage schedules need not be modified in the presence of mild or moderate renal or hepatic disease. No significant levels of clindamycin are attained in the cerebrospinal fluid, even in the presence of inflamed meninges. Pharmacokinetic studies in elderly volunteers (61 to 79 years) and younger adults (18 to 39 years) indicate that age alone does not alter clindamycin pharmacokinetics (clearance, elimination half-life, volume of distribution, and area under the serum concentration-time curve) after I.V. administration of clindamycin phosphate. After oral administration of clindamycin hydrochloride, elimination half-life is increased to approximately 4 hours (range 3.4 to 5.1 h) in the elderly compared to 3.2 hours (range 2.1 to 4.2 h) in younger adults. The extent of absorption, however, is not different between the age groups and no dosage alteration is necessary for the elderly with normal hepatic function and normal (age-adjusted) renal function 1 . Serum assays for active clindamycin require an inhibitor to prevent in vitro hydrolysis of clindamycin phosphate.

Microbiology: Although clindamycin phosphate is inactive in vitro , rapid in vivo hydrolysis converts this compound to the antibacterially active clindamycin. Clindamycin has been shown to have in vitro activity against isolates of the following organisms: Aerobic gram positive cocci, including: Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase and non-penicillinase producing strains). When tested by in vitro methods, some staphylococcal strains originally resistant to erythromycin rapidly develop resistance to clindamycin. Staphylococcus epidermidis (penicillinase and non-penicillinase producing strains). When tested by in vitro methods, some staphylococcal strains originally resistant to erythromycin rapidly develop resistance to clindamycin. Streptococci (except Enterococcus faecalis) Pneumococci Anaerobic gram negative bacilli, including: Bacteroides species (including Bacteroides fragilis group and Bacteroides melaninogenicus group) Fusobacterium species Anaerobic gram positive nonsporeforming bacilli , including: Propionibacterium Eubacterium Actinomyces species Anaerobic and microaerophilic gram positive cocci , including: Peptococcus species Peptostreptococcus species Microaerophilic streptococci Clostridia : Clostridia are more resistant than most anaerobes to clindamycin. Most Clostridium perfringens are susceptible, but other species, e.g., Clostridium sporogenes and Clostridium tertium are frequently resistant to clindamycin. Susceptibility testing should be done. Cross resistance has been demonstrated between clindamycin and lincomycin. Antagonism has been demonstrated betweeen clindamycin and erythromycin. In vitro Susceptibility Testing: Disk diffusion technique-Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters give the most precise estimates of antibiotic susceptibility. One such procedure 2 has been recommended for use with disks to test susceptibility to clindamycin. Reports from a laboratory using the standardized single-disk susceptibility test 1 with a 2 mcg clindamycin disk should be interpreted according to the following criteria: Susceptible organisms produce zones of 17 mm or greater, indicating that the tested organism is likely to respond to therapy. Organisms of intermediate susceptibility produce zones of 15-16 mm, indicating that the tested organism would be susceptible if a high dosage is used or if the infection is confined to tissues and fluids (e.g., urine), in which high antibiotic levels are attained. Resistant organisms produce zones of 14 mm or less, indicating that other therapy should be selected. Standardized procedures require the use of control organisms. The 2 mcg clindamycin disk should give a zone diameter between 24 and 30 mm for S. aureus ATCC 25923. Dilution techniques \u2212 A bacterial isolate may be considered susceptible if the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for clindamycin is not more than 1.6 mcg/mL. Organisms are considered moderately susceptible if the MIC is greater than 1.6 mcg/mL and less than or equal to 4.8 mcg/mL. Organisms are considered resistant if the MIC is greater than 4.8 mcg per mL. The range of MIC\u2019s for the control strains are as follows: S. aureus ATCC 29213, 0.06 to 0.25 mcg/mL. E. faecalis ATCC 29212, 4 to 16 mcg/mL. For anaerobic bacteria the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of clindamycin can be determined by agar dilution and broth dilution (including microdilution) techniques. 3 If MICs are not determined routinely, the disk broth method is recommended for routine use. The KIRBY-BAUER DISK DIFFUSION METHOD AND ITS INTERPRETIVE STANDARDS ARE NOT RECOMMENDED FOR ANAEROBES."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Effects on endocrine system: Betamethasone dipropionate cream (augmented) can cause reversible HPA axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency during and after withdrawal of treatment. Risk factor(s) include the use of high-potency topical corticosteroids, use over a large surface area or to areas under occlusion, prolonged use, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and use in pediatric patients. Modify use should HPA axis suppression develop. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions: Betamethasone dipropionate cream (augmented) may increase the risk of cataracts and glaucoma. If visual symptoms occur, consider referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Effects on Endocrine System Betamethasone dipropionate cream (augmented) can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or after withdrawal of treatment. Factors that predispose to HPA axis suppression include the use of high-potency steroids, large treatment surface areas, prolonged use, use of occlusive dressings, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and young age. Evaluation for HPA axis suppression may be done by using the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test. Betamethasone dipropionate cream (augmented), 0.05% was applied once daily at 7 grams per day for 1 week to diseased skin, in adult subjects with psoriasis or atopic dermatitis, to study its effects on the HPA axis. The results suggested that the drug lowered adrenal corticosteroid secretion, although plasma cortisol levels did not go below the lower limit of the normal range. In an open-label pediatric trial of 60 evaluable subjects (3 months to 12 years of age), 19 subjects showed evidence of HPA axis suppression. Four (4) subjects were tested 2 weeks after discontinuation of betamethasone dipropionate cream (augmented), 0.05%, and 3 of the 4 (75%) had complete recovery of HPA axis function. The proportion of subjects with adrenal suppression in this trial was progressively greater, the younger the age group. If HPA axis suppression is documented, gradually withdraw the drug, reduce the frequency of application, or substitute with a less potent corticosteroid. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of steroid withdrawal may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Cushing's syndrome and hyperglycemia may also occur with topical corticosteroids. These events are rare and generally occur after prolonged exposure to excessively large doses, especially of high-potency topical corticosteroids. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. 5.2 Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions Use of topical corticosteroids, including betamethasone dipropionate cream (augmented), may increase the risk of posterior subcapsular cataracts and glaucoma. Cataracts and glaucoma have been reported postmarketing with the use of topical corticosteroid products, including betamethasone dipropionate cream (augmented) [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . 5.3 Allergic Contact Dermatitis Allergic contact dermatitis with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic patch testing. If irritation develops, topical corticosteroids should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reaction reported in 0.4% of adult patients is stinging. ( 6.1 ) The most common adverse reactions reported in 10% of pediatric patients are signs of skin atrophy, telangiectasia, bruising, shininess. ( 6.1 , 8.4 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc., at 1-866-923-4914 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. In controlled clinical trials, involving 242 adult subjects, the adverse reaction associated with the use of betamethasone dipropionate cream (augmented) reported at a frequency of 0.4% was stinging. It occurred in 1 subject. In a controlled clinical trial involving 67 pediatric subjects from 3 months to 12 years of age, the adverse reactions associated with the use of betamethasone dipropionate cream (augmented) occurred in 7 of 67 (10%) subjects. Reported reactions included signs of skin atrophy (telangiectasia, bruising, shininess). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Postmarketing reports for local adverse reactions to topical corticosteroids may also include: burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, hypertrichosis, skin atrophy, striae, and miliaria. Hypersensitivity reactions, consisting of predominantly skin signs and symptoms, e.g., contact dermatitis, pruritus, bullous dermatitis, and erythematous rash have been reported. Ophthalmic adverse reactions of cataracts, glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and central serous chorioretinopathy have been reported with the use of topical corticosteroids, including topical betamethasone products."

Observational studies suggest an increased risk of low birthweight infants with the use of greater than 300 grams of potent or very potent topical corticosteroid during a pregnancy. Advise pregnant women that betamethasone dipropionate cream (augmented) may increase the risk of having a low birthweight infant and to use betamethasone dipropionate cream (augmented) on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible. In animal reproduction studies, increased malformations, including umbilical hernias, cephalocele, and cleft palate, were observed after intramuscular administration of betamethasone dipropionate to pregnant rabbits. The available data do not allow the calculation of relevant comparisons between the systemic exposure of betamethasone dipropionate in animal studies to the systemic exposure that would be expected in humans after topical use of betamethasone dipropionate cream (augmented) (see Data ) . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Betamethasone dipropionate has been shown to cause malformations in rabbits when given by the intramuscular route at doses of 0.05 mg/kg. The abnormalities observed included umbilical hernias, cephalocele, and cleft palate. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data regarding the excretion of betamethasone dipropionate in breast milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production after topical application of betamethasone dipropionate cream (augmented) to women who are breastfeeding. It is possible that topical administration of large amounts of betamethasone dipropionate could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for betamethasone dipropionate cream (augmented) and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from betamethasone dipropionate cream (augmented) or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations To minimize potential exposure to the breastfed infant via breast milk, use betamethasone dipropionate cream (augmented) on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible while breastfeeding. Advise breastfeeding women not to apply betamethasone dipropionate cream (augmented) directly to the nipple and areola to avoid direct infant exposure [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Use of betamethasone dipropionate cream (augmented) in pediatric patients younger than 13 years of age is not recommended due to the potential for HPA axis suppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . In an open-label HPA axis safety trial in subjects 3 months to 12 years of age with atopic dermatitis, betamethasone dipropionate cream (augmented), 0.05% was applied twice daily for 2 to 3 weeks over a mean body surface area of 58% (range 35% to 95%). In 19 of 60 (32%) evaluable subjects, adrenal suppression was indicated by either a \u22645 mcg/dL pre-stimulation cortisol, or a cosyntropin post-stimulation cortisol \u226418 mcg/dL and/or an increase of <7 mcg/dL from the baseline cortisol. Out of the 19 subjects with HPA axis suppression, 4 subjects were tested 2 weeks after discontinuation of betamethasone dipropionate cream (augmented), and 3 of the 4 (75%) had complete recovery of HPA axis function. The proportion of subjects with adrenal suppression in this trial was progressively greater, the younger the age group. Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, pediatric patients are at a greater risk than adults of systemic toxicity when treated with topical drugs. They are, therefore, also at greater risk of HPA axis suppression and adrenal insufficiency upon the use of topical corticosteroids. Rare systemic effects such as Cushing's syndrome, linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in pediatric patients, especially those with prolonged exposure to large doses of high potency topical corticosteroids. Local adverse reactions including skin atrophy have also been reported with use of topical corticosteroids in pediatric patients. Avoid use of betamethasone dipropionate cream (augmented) in the treatment of diaper dermatitis. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of betamethasone dipropionate cream (augmented) included 104 subjects who were 65 years of age and over and 8 subjects who were 75 years of age and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. However, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

However, similar blanching scores do not necessarily imply therapeutic equivalence. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics No pharmacokinetics trials have been conducted with betamethasone dipropionate cream (augmented), 0.05%. The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed through normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids enter pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees, are metabolized primarily in the liver, and excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile."

        "Drug Interactions ACE-inhibitors Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE-inhibitors. This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors (see PRECAUTIONS , General , Renal Effects ). Antacids The concomitant administration of antacids has no apparent effect on the extent of absorption of etodolac. However, antacids can decrease the peak concentration reached by 15% to 20% but have no detectable effect on the time-to-peak. Aspirin When etodolac is administered with aspirin, its protein binding is reduced, although the clearance of free etodolac is not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known; however, as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of etodolac and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects. Cyclosporine, Digoxin, Methotrexate Etodolac, like other NSAIDs, through effects on renal prostaglandins, may cause changes in the elimination of these drugs leading to elevated serum levels of cyclosporine, digoxin, methotrexate, and increased toxicity. Nephrotoxicity associated with cyclosporine may also be enhanced. Patients receiving these drugs who are given etodolac, or any other NSAID, and particularly those patients with altered renal function, should be observed for the development of the specific toxicities of these drugs. NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are administered concomitantly with methotrexate. Diuretics Etodolac has no apparent pharmacokinetic interaction when administered with furosemide or hydrochlorothiazide. Nevertheless, clinical studies, as well as postmarketing observations have shown that etodolac can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure (see WARNINGS, Renal Effects ), as well as to assure diuretic efficacy. Glyburide Etodolac has no apparent pharmacokinetic interaction when administered with glyburide. Lithium NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity. Phenylbutazone Phenylbutazone causes increase (by about 80%) in the free fraction of etodolac. Although in vivo studies have not been done to see if etodolac clearance is changed by coadministration of phenylbutazone, it is not recommended that they be coadministered. Phenytoin Etodolac has no apparent pharmacokinetic interaction when administered with phenytoin. Warfarin The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than that of users of either drug alone. Short-term pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that concomitant administration of warfarin and etodolac results in reduced protein binding of warfarin, but there was no change in the clearance of free warfarin. There was no significant difference in the pharmacodynamic effect of warfarin administered alone and warfarin administered with etodolac as measured by prothrombin time. Thus, concomitant therapy with warfarin and etodolac should not require dosage adjustment of either drug. However, caution should be exercised because there have been a few spontaneous reports of prolonged prothrombin times, with or without bleeding, in etodolac-treated patients receiving concomitant warfarin therapy."

      "geriatric_use": [
        "Geriatric Use As with any NSAID, caution should be exercised in treating the elderly (65 years and older) and when increasing the dose (see WARNINGS ). In etodolac clinical studies, no overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. In pharmacokinetic studies, age was shown not to have any effect on etodolac half-life or protein binding, and there was no change in expected drug accumulation. Therefore, no dosage adjustment is generally necessary in the elderly on the basis of pharmacokinetics (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Special Populations ). Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the antiprostaglandin effects of NSAIDs (on the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys) than younger patients (see WARNINGS ). In particular, elderly or debilitated patients who receive NSAID therapy seem to tolerate gastrointestinal ulceration or bleeding less well than other individuals, and most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in this population. Etodolac is eliminated primarily by the kidney. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function (see PRECAUTIONS , Renal Effects )."
      ],
      "precautions": [
        "PRECAUTIONS General Etodolac cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered solely if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids. The pharmacological activity of etodolac in reducing fever and inflammation may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions. Hepatic Effects Borderline elevations of one or more liver tests may occur in up to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs including etodolac. These laboratory abnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged, or may be transient with continuing therapy. Notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately three or more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs. In addition, rare cases of severe hepatic reactions, including jaundice and fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure, some of them with fatal outcomes, have been reported. A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be evaluated for evidence of the development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with etodolac. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), etodolac should be discontinued. Hematological Effects Anemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving NSAIDs including etodolac. This may be due to fluid retention, occult or gross GI blood loss, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs, including etodolac, should have their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia. NSAIDS inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect on platelet function is quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible. Patients receiving etodolac who may be adversely affected by alterations in platelet function, such as those with coagulation disorders or patients receiving anticoagulants, should be carefully monitored. Pre-existing Asthma Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthmas has been associated with severe bronchospasm which can be fatal. Since cross reactivity, including bronchospasm, between aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, etodolac should not be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be used with caution in all patients with pre-existing asthma. Information For Patients Patients should be informed of the following information before initiating therapy with an NSAID and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy. Patients should also be encouraged to read the NSAID Medication Guide that accompanies each prescription dispensed. Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of cardiovascular thrombotic events, including chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, or slurring of speech, and to report any of these symptoms to their health care provider immediately (see WARNINGS ). Etodolac, like other NSAIDs, can cause GI discomfort and, rarely, serious GI side effects, such as ulcers and bleeding, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up (see WARNINGS, Gastrointestinal Effects, Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation) . Etodolac, like other NSAIDs, can cause serious skin side effects such as exfoliative dermatitis, SJS, and TEN, which may result in hospitalizations and even death. Although serious skin reactions may occur without warning, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of skin rash and blisters, fever, or other signs of hypersensitivity such as itching, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative signs or symptoms. Patients should be advised to stop the drug immediately if they develop any type of rash and contact their physicians as soon as possible. Heart Failure And Edema Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of congestive heart failure including shortness of breath, unexplained weight gain, or edema and to contact their healthcare provider if such symptoms occur (see WARNINGS ). Patients should be informed of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and \u201cflu-like\u201d symptoms). If these occur, patients should be instructed to stop therapy and seek immediate medical therapy. Patients should be informed of the signs of an anaphylactoid reaction (e.g., difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat). If these occur, patients should be instructed to seek immediate emergency help (see WARNINGS ). In late pregnancy, the third trimester, as with other NSAIDs, etodolac should be avoided because it may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus. Laboratory Tests Because serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI bleeding. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs should have their CBC and a chemistry profile checked periodically for signs or symptoms of anemia. Appropriate measures should be taken in case such signs of anemia occur. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver or renal disease develop or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.) and if abnormal liver tests are detected, persist or worsen, etodolac should be discontinued. Drug Interactions ACE-inhibitors Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE-inhibitors. This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors (see PRECAUTIONS , General , Renal Effects ).

Thus, concomitant therapy with warfarin and etodolac should not require dosage adjustment of either drug. However, caution should be exercised because there have been a few spontaneous reports of prolonged prothrombin times, with or without bleeding, in etodolac-treated patients receiving concomitant warfarin therapy. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions The urine of patients who take etodolac can give a false-positive reaction for urinary bilirubin (urobilin) due to the presence of phenolic metabolites of etodolac. Diagnostic dip-stick methodology, used to detect ketone bodies in urine, has resulted in false-positive findings in some patients treated with etodolac. Generally, this phenomenon has not been associated with other clinically significant events. No dose relationship has been observed. Etodolac treatment is associated with a small decrease in serum uric acid levels. In clinical trials, mean decreases of 1 to 2 mg/dL were observed in arthritic patients receiving etodolac (600 mg to 1,000 mg/day) after 4 weeks of therapy. These levels then remained stable for up to 1 year of therapy. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility No carcinogenic effect of etodolac was observed in mice or rats receiving oral doses of 15 mg/kg/day (45 to 89 mg/m 2 , respectively) or less for periods of 2 years or 18 months, respectively. Etodolac was not mutagenic in in vitro tests performed with S. typhimurium and mouse lymphoma cells as well as in an in vivo mouse micronucleus test. However, data from the in vitro human peripheral lymphocyte test showed an increase in the number of gaps (3.0 to 5.3% unstained regions in the chromatid without dislocation) among the etodolac-treated cultures (50 to 200 mcg/mL) compared to negative controls (2.0%); no other difference was noted between the controls and drug-treated groups. Etodolac showed no impairment of fertility in male and female rats up to oral doses of 16 mg/kg (94 mg/m 2 ). However, reduced implantation of fertilized eggs occurred in the 8 mg/kg group. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects - Pregnancy Category C In teratology studies, isolated occurrences of alterations in limb development were found and included polydactyly, oligodactyly, syndactyly, and unossified phalanges in rats and oligodactyly and synostosis of metatarsals in rabbits. These were observed at dose levels (2 to 14 mg/kg/day) close to human clinical doses. However, the frequency and the dosage group distribution of these findings in initial or repeated studies did not establish a clear drug or dose-response relationship. Animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response. There are no adequate or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Etodolac should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects Etodolac should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefits justify the potential risk to the fetus. Because of the known effects of NSAIDs on parturition and on the human fetal cardiovascular system with respect to closure of the ductus arteriosus, use during late pregnancy should be avoided. Labor and Delivery In rat studies with NSAIDs, as with other drugs known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, an increased incidence of dystocia, delayed parturition, and decreased pup survival occurred. The effects of etodolac on labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether etodolac is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from etodolac, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been established. Geriatric Use As with any NSAID, caution should be exercised in treating the elderly (65 years and older) and when increasing the dose (see WARNINGS ). In etodolac clinical studies, no overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. In pharmacokinetic studies, age was shown not to have any effect on etodolac half-life or protein binding, and there was no change in expected drug accumulation. Therefore, no dosage adjustment is generally necessary in the elderly on the basis of pharmacokinetics (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Special Populations ).

        "General Etodolac cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered solely if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids. The pharmacological activity of etodolac in reducing fever and inflammation may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions. Hepatic Effects Borderline elevations of one or more liver tests may occur in up to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs including etodolac. These laboratory abnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged, or may be transient with continuing therapy. Notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately three or more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs. In addition, rare cases of severe hepatic reactions, including jaundice and fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure, some of them with fatal outcomes, have been reported. A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be evaluated for evidence of the development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with etodolac. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), etodolac should be discontinued. Hematological Effects Anemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving NSAIDs including etodolac. This may be due to fluid retention, occult or gross GI blood loss, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs, including etodolac, should have their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia. NSAIDS inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect on platelet function is quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible. Patients receiving etodolac who may be adversely affected by alterations in platelet function, such as those with coagulation disorders or patients receiving anticoagulants, should be carefully monitored. Pre-existing Asthma Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthmas has been associated with severe bronchospasm which can be fatal. Since cross reactivity, including bronchospasm, between aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, etodolac should not be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be used with caution in all patients with pre-existing asthma."

        "Pharmacokinetics Absorption The systemic bioavailability of etodolac is 100% as compared to solution and at least 80% as determined from mass balance studies. Etodolac is well absorbed and had a relative bioavailability of 100% when 200 mg capsules were compared with a solution of etodolac. Based on mass balance studies, the systemic availability of etodolac from either the tablet or capsule formulation is at least 80%. Etodolac does not undergo significant first-pass metabolism following oral administration. Mean (\u00b1 1 SD) peak plasma concentrations (C max ) range from approximately 14 \u00b1 4 to 37 \u00b1 9 mcg/mL after 200 to 600 mg single doses and are reached in 80 \u00b1 30 minutes (see Table 1 for summary of pharmacokinetic parameters). The dose-proportionality based on the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) is linear following doses up to 600 mg every 12 hours. Peak concentrations are dose proportional for both total and free etodolac following doses up to 400 mg every 12 hours, but following a 600 mg dose, the peak is about 20% higher than predicted on the basis of lower doses. The extent of absorption of etodolac is not affected when etodolac is administered after a meal. Food intake, however, reduces the peak concentration reached by approximately one-half and increases the time to peak concentration by 1.4 to 3.8 hours. Table 1.

Etodolac is more than 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to albumin. The free fraction is less than 1% and is independent of etodolac total concentration over the dose range studied. It is not known whether etodolac is excreted in human milk; however, based on its physical-chemical properties, excretion into breast milk is expected. Data from in vitro studies, using peak serum concentrations at reported therapeutic doses in humans, show that the etodolac free fraction is not significantly altered by acetaminophen, ibuprofen, indomethacin, naproxen, piroxicam, chlorpropamide, glipizide, glyburide, phenytoin, and probenecid. Metabolism Etodolac is extensively metabolized in the liver. The role, if any, of a specific cytochrome P450 system in the metabolism of etodolac is unknown. Several etodolac metabolites have been identified in human plasma and urine. Other metabolites remain to be identified. The metabolites include 6-, 7-, and 8-hydroxylated-etodolac and etodolac glucuronide. After a single dose of 14C-etodolac, hydroxylated metabolites accounted for less than 10% of total drug in serum. On chronic dosing, hydroxylated-etodolac metabolite does not accumulate in the plasma of patients with normal renal function. The extent of accumulation of hydroxylated-etodolac metabolites in patients with renal dysfunction has not been studied. The hydroxylated-etodolac metabolites undergo further glucuronidation followed by renal excretion and partial elimination in the feces. Excretion The mean oral clearance of etodolac following oral dosing is 49 (\u00b116) mL/h/kg. Approximately 1% of an etodolac dose is excreted unchanged in the urine with 72% of the dose excreted into urine as parent drug plus metabolite: - etodolac, unchanged 1% - etodolac glucuronide 13% - hydroxylated metabolites (6-, 7-, and 8-OH) 5% - hydroxylated metabolite glucuronides 20% - unidentified metabolites 33% Although renal elimination is a significant pathway of excretion for etodolac metabolites, no dosing adjustment in patients with mild to moderate renal dysfunction is generally necessary. The terminal half-life (t \u00bd ) of etodolac is 6.4 hours (22% CV). In patients with severe renal dysfunction or undergoing hemodialysis, dosing adjustment is not generally necessary.

      "warnings": [
        "WARNINGS Cardiovascular Effects Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as etodolac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events (see WARNINGS ). Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Post-MI Patients Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up. Avoid the use of etodolac in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If etodolac is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia. Hypertension NSAIDs, including etodolac, can lead to onset of new hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking thiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. NSAIDs, including etodolac, should be used with caution in patients with hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) should be monitored closely during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy. Heart Failure and Edema The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists\u2019 Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death. Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of etodolac may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions [e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)] (see Drug Interactions ). Avoid the use of etodolac in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If etodolac is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure. Gastrointestinal (GI) Effects - Risk of GI Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation NSAIDs, including etodolac, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for 1 year. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk. Physicians should inform patients about the signs and/or symptoms of serious GI toxicity and what steps to take if they occur. NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease, and/or gastrointestinal bleeding, and who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold risk for developing a GI bleed than patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly of debilitated patients, and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered. Renal Effects Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at a greater risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state. Renal pelvic transitional epithelial hyperplasia, a spontaneous change occurring with variable frequency, was observed with increased frequency in treated male rats in a 2-year chronic study. Advanced Renal Disease No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of etodolac in patients with advanced renal disease. Therefore, treatment with etodolac is not recommended in these patients with advanced renal disease. If etodolac therapy must be initiated, close monitoring of the patient\u2019s renal function is advisable. Anaphylactoid Reactions As with other NSAIDS, anaphylactoid reactions may occur in patients without prior exposure to etodolac. Etodolac should not be given to patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs in asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. Fatal reactions have been reported in such patients (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS , General , Pre-existing Asthma ). Emergency help should be sought in cases where an anaphylactoid reaction occurs. Skin Reactions NSAIDs, including etodolac, can cause serious skin adverse events such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of serious skin manifestations and use of the drug should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Pregnancy In late pregnancy, the third trimester, as with other NSAIDs, etodolac should be avoided because it may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus (see PRECAUTIONS , Pregnancy , Non-teratogenic Effects )."

Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS ). After observing the response to the initial therapy with etodolac, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs. Dosage adjustment of etodolac is generally not required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Etodolac should be used with caution in such patients, because, as with other NSAIDs, it may further decrease renal function in some patients with impaired renal function (see WARNINGS, Renal Effects ). Analgesia The recommended total daily dose of etodolac for acute pain is up to 1,000 mg, given as 200 to 400 mg every 6 to 8 hours. Doses of etodolac greater than 1,000 mg/day have not been adequately evaluated in well-controlled clinical trials. Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis The recommended starting dose of etodolac for the management of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis is: 300 mg b.i.d., t.i.d., or 400 mg b.i.d., or 500 mg b.i.d. A lower dose of 600 mg/day may suffice for long-term administration. Physicians should be aware that doses above 1,000 mg/day have not been adequately evaluated in well-controlled clinical trials. In chronic conditions, a therapeutic response to therapy with etodolac is sometimes seen within one week of therapy, but most often is observed by two weeks. After a satisfactory response has been achieved, the patient's dose should be reviewed and adjusted as required."

        "Special Populations Geriatric In etodolac clinical studies, no overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. In pharmacokinetic studies, age was shown not to have any effect on etodolac half-life or protein binding, and there was no change in expected drug accumulation. Therefore, no dosage adjustment is generally necessary in the elderly on the basis of pharmacokinetics (see PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use ). Etodolac is eliminated primarily by the kidney. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function (see WARNINGS, Renal Effects ). Pediatric Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been established. Race Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified. Clinical studies included patients of many races, all of whom responded in a similar fashion. Hepatic Insufficiency Etodolac is predominantly metabolized by the liver. In patients with compensated hepatic cirrhosis, the disposition of total and free etodolac is not altered. Patients with acute and chronic hepatic diseases do not generally require reduced doses of etodolac compared to patients with normal hepatic function. However, etodolac clearance is dependent on liver function and could be reduced in patients with severe hepatic failure. Etodolac plasma protein binding did not change in patients with compensated hepatic cirrhosis given etodolac. Renal Insufficiency Etodolac pharmacokinetics have been investigated in subjects with renal insufficiency. Etodolac renal clearance was unchanged in the presence of mild-to-moderate renal failure (creatinine clearance 37 to 88 mL/min). Furthermore, there were no significant differences in the disposition of total and free etodolac in these patients. However, etodolac should be used with caution in such patients because, as with other NSAIDs, it may further decrease renal function in some patients. In patients undergoing hemodialysis, there was a 50% greater apparent clearance of total etodolac, due to a 50% greater unbound fraction. Free etodolac clearance was not altered, indicating the importance of protein binding in etodolac's disposition. Etodolac is not significantly removed from the blood in patients undergoing hemodialysis."

The analgesic effective dose for etodolac established in these acute pain models was 200 to 400 mg. The onset of analgesia occurred approximately 30 minutes after oral administration. Etodolac 200 mg provided efficacy comparable to that obtained with aspirin (650 mg). Etodolac 400 mg provided efficacy comparable to that obtained with acetaminophen with codeine (600 mg + 60 mg). The peak analgesic effect was between 1 to 2 hours. Duration of relief averaged 4 to 5 hours for 200 mg of etodolac and 5 to 6 hours for 400 mg of etodolac as measured by when approximately half of the patients required remedication. Osteoarthritis The use of etodolac in managing the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis of the hip or knee was assessed in double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trials in 341 patients. In patients with osteoarthritis of the knee, etodolac, in doses of 600 to 1,000 mg/day, was better than placebo in two studies. The clinical trials in osteoarthritis used b.i.d. dosage regimens. Rheumatoid Arthritis In a 3-month study with 426 patients, etodolac 300 mg b.i.d. was effective in management of rheumatoid arthritis and comparable in efficacy to piroxicam 20 mg/day.

        "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacodynamics Etodolac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that exhibits anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activities in animal models. The mechanism of action of etodolac, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood, but may be related to prostaglandin synthetase inhibition. Etodolac is a racemic mixture of [-]R- and [+]S-etodolac. As with other NSAIDs, it has been demonstrated in animals that the [+]S-form is biologically active. Both enantiomers are stable and there is no [-]R to [+]S conversion in vivo . Pharmacokinetics Absorption The systemic bioavailability of etodolac is 100% as compared to solution and at least 80% as determined from mass balance studies. Etodolac is well absorbed and had a relative bioavailability of 100% when 200 mg capsules were compared with a solution of etodolac. Based on mass balance studies, the systemic availability of etodolac from either the tablet or capsule formulation is at least 80%. Etodolac does not undergo significant first-pass metabolism following oral administration. Mean (\u00b1 1 SD) peak plasma concentrations (C max ) range from approximately 14 \u00b1 4 to 37 \u00b1 9 mcg/mL after 200 to 600 mg single doses and are reached in 80 \u00b1 30 minutes (see Table 1 for summary of pharmacokinetic parameters). The dose-proportionality based on the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) is linear following doses up to 600 mg every 12 hours. Peak concentrations are dose proportional for both total and free etodolac following doses up to 400 mg every 12 hours, but following a 600 mg dose, the peak is about 20% higher than predicted on the basis of lower doses. The extent of absorption of etodolac is not affected when etodolac is administered after a meal. Food intake, however, reduces the peak concentration reached by approximately one-half and increases the time to peak concentration by 1.4 to 3.8 hours. Table 1.

Etodolac is more than 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to albumin. The free fraction is less than 1% and is independent of etodolac total concentration over the dose range studied. It is not known whether etodolac is excreted in human milk; however, based on its physical-chemical properties, excretion into breast milk is expected. Data from in vitro studies, using peak serum concentrations at reported therapeutic doses in humans, show that the etodolac free fraction is not significantly altered by acetaminophen, ibuprofen, indomethacin, naproxen, piroxicam, chlorpropamide, glipizide, glyburide, phenytoin, and probenecid. Metabolism Etodolac is extensively metabolized in the liver. The role, if any, of a specific cytochrome P450 system in the metabolism of etodolac is unknown. Several etodolac metabolites have been identified in human plasma and urine. Other metabolites remain to be identified. The metabolites include 6-, 7-, and 8-hydroxylated-etodolac and etodolac glucuronide. After a single dose of 14C-etodolac, hydroxylated metabolites accounted for less than 10% of total drug in serum. On chronic dosing, hydroxylated-etodolac metabolite does not accumulate in the plasma of patients with normal renal function. The extent of accumulation of hydroxylated-etodolac metabolites in patients with renal dysfunction has not been studied. The hydroxylated-etodolac metabolites undergo further glucuronidation followed by renal excretion and partial elimination in the feces. Excretion The mean oral clearance of etodolac following oral dosing is 49 (\u00b116) mL/h/kg. Approximately 1% of an etodolac dose is excreted unchanged in the urine with 72% of the dose excreted into urine as parent drug plus metabolite: - etodolac, unchanged 1% - etodolac glucuronide 13% - hydroxylated metabolites (6-, 7-, and 8-OH) 5% - hydroxylated metabolite glucuronides 20% - unidentified metabolites 33% Although renal elimination is a significant pathway of excretion for etodolac metabolites, no dosing adjustment in patients with mild to moderate renal dysfunction is generally necessary. The terminal half-life (t \u00bd ) of etodolac is 6.4 hours (22% CV). In patients with severe renal dysfunction or undergoing hemodialysis, dosing adjustment is not generally necessary. Fecal excretion accounted for 16% of the dose. Special Populations Geriatric In etodolac clinical studies, no overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. In pharmacokinetic studies, age was shown not to have any effect on etodolac half-life or protein binding, and there was no change in expected drug accumulation. Therefore, no dosage adjustment is generally necessary in the elderly on the basis of pharmacokinetics (see PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use ). Etodolac is eliminated primarily by the kidney. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function (see WARNINGS, Renal Effects ). Pediatric Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been established. Race Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified. Clinical studies included patients of many races, all of whom responded in a similar fashion. Hepatic Insufficiency Etodolac is predominantly metabolized by the liver. In patients with compensated hepatic cirrhosis, the disposition of total and free etodolac is not altered. Patients with acute and chronic hepatic diseases do not generally require reduced doses of etodolac compared to patients with normal hepatic function. However, etodolac clearance is dependent on liver function and could be reduced in patients with severe hepatic failure. Etodolac plasma protein binding did not change in patients with compensated hepatic cirrhosis given etodolac. Renal Insufficiency Etodolac pharmacokinetics have been investigated in subjects with renal insufficiency. Etodolac renal clearance was unchanged in the presence of mild-to-moderate renal failure (creatinine clearance 37 to 88 mL/min). Furthermore, there were no significant differences in the disposition of total and free etodolac in these patients. However, etodolac should be used with caution in such patients because, as with other NSAIDs, it may further decrease renal function in some patients. In patients undergoing hemodialysis, there was a 50% greater apparent clearance of total etodolac, due to a 50% greater unbound fraction. Free etodolac clearance was not altered, indicating the importance of protein binding in etodolac's disposition. Etodolac is not significantly removed from the blood in patients undergoing hemodialysis."

        "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility No carcinogenic effect of etodolac was observed in mice or rats receiving oral doses of 15 mg/kg/day (45 to 89 mg/m 2 , respectively) or less for periods of 2 years or 18 months, respectively. Etodolac was not mutagenic in in vitro tests performed with S. typhimurium and mouse lymphoma cells as well as in an in vivo mouse micronucleus test. However, data from the in vitro human peripheral lymphocyte test showed an increase in the number of gaps (3.0 to 5.3% unstained regions in the chromatid without dislocation) among the etodolac-treated cultures (50 to 200 mcg/mL) compared to negative controls (2.0%); no other difference was noted between the controls and drug-treated groups. Etodolac showed no impairment of fertility in male and female rats up to oral doses of 16 mg/kg (94 mg/m 2 ). However, reduced implantation of fertilized eggs occurred in the 8 mg/kg group."

      "nonteratogenic_effects": [
        "Nonteratogenic Effects Etodolac should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefits justify the potential risk to the fetus. Because of the known effects of NSAIDs on parturition and on the human fetal cardiovascular system with respect to closure of the ductus arteriosus, use during late pregnancy should be avoided."
      ],
      "overdosage": [
        "OVERDOSAGE Symptoms following acute NSAID overdose are usually limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which are generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur and coma has occurred following massive ibuprofen or mefenamic-acid overdose. Hypertension, acute renal failure, and respiratory depression may occur but are rare. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with therapeutic ingestion of NSAIDs, and may occur following overdose. Patients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care following an NSAID overdose. There are no specific antidotes. Emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 g in adults, 1 to 2 g/kg in children) and/or osmotic cathartic may be indicated in patients seen within 4 hours of ingestion with symptoms or following a large overdose (5 to 10 times the usual dose). Forced diuresis, alkalinization of the urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion would probably not be useful due to etodolac's high protein binding."

Severe hypercalcemia may require hemodialysis and discontinuation of calcium acetate capsules. ( 5.1 ) Hypercalcemia may aggravate digitalis toxicity. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Hypercalcemia Patients with end stage renal disease may develop hypercalcemia when treated with calcium, including calcium acetate. Avoid the use of calcium supplements, including calcium based nonprescription antacids, concurrently with calcium acetate. An overdose of calcium acetate may lead to progressive hypercalcemia, which may require emergency measures. Therefore, early in the treatment phase during the dosage adjustment period, monitor serum calcium levels twice weekly. Should hypercalcemia develop, reduce the calcium acetate dosage, or discontinue the treatment, depending on the severity of hypercalcemia. More severe hypercalcemia (Ca >12 mg/dL) is associated with confusion, delirium, stupor and coma. Severe hypercalcemia can be treated by acute hemodialysis and discontinuing calcium acetate therapy. Mild hypercalcemia (10.5 to 11.9 mg/dL) may be asymptomatic or manifest as constipation, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. Mild hypercalcemia is usually controlled by reducing the calcium acetate dose or temporarily discontinuing therapy. Decreasing or discontinuing Vitamin D therapy is recommended as well. Chronic hypercalcemia may lead to vascular calcification and other soft-tissue calcification. Radiographic evaluation of suspected anatomical regions may be helpful in early detection of soft tissue calcification. The long term effect of calcium acetate on the progression of vascular or soft tissue calcification has not been determined. Hypercalcemia (>11 mg/dL) was reported in 16% of patients in a 3-month study of solid dose formulation of calcium acetate; all cases resolved upon lowering the dose or discontinuing treatment. Maintain the serum calcium-phosphorus (Ca x P) product below 55 mg 2 /dL 2 . 5.2 Concomitant Use with Medications Hypercalcemia may aggravate digitalis toxicity."

In clinical studies, calcium acetate has been generally well tolerated. Calcium acetate was studied in a 3-month, open-label, non-randomized study of 98 enrolled ESRD hemodialysis patients and an alternate liquid formulation of calcium acetate was studied in a two week double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study with 69 enrolled ESRD hemodialysis patients.

Decreasing dialysate calcium concentration could reduce the incidence and severity of calcium acetate - induced hypercalcemia. Isolated cases of pruritus have been reported, which may represent allergic reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval of calcium acetate: dizziness, edema, and weakness."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The drug interaction of calcium acetate is characterized by the potential of calcium to bind to drugs with anionic functions (e.g., carboxyl, and hydroxyl groups). Calcium acetate may decrease the bioavailability of tetracyclines or fluoroquinolones via this mechanism. There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between calcium acetate and most concomitant drugs. When administering an oral medication with calcium acetate where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy, administer the drug one hour before or three hours after calcium acetate. Monitor blood levels of the concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range. Patients taking anti-arrhythmic medications for the control of arrhythmias and anti-seizure medications for the control of seizure disorders were excluded from the clinical trials with all forms of calcium acetate. Calcium acetate may decrease the bioavailability of tetracyclines or fluoroquinolones. ( 7 ) When clinically significant drug interactions are expected, administer the drug at least one hour before or at least three hours after calcium acetate or consider monitoring blood levels of the drug. ( 7 ) 7.1 Ciprofloxacin In a study of 15 healthy subjects, a co-administered single dose of 4 calcium acetate tablets, approximately 2.7g, decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50%."

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C Calcium acetate capsules contain calcium acetate. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with calcium acetate, and there are no adequate and well controlled studies of calcium acetate use in pregnant women. Patients with end stage renal disease may develop hypercalcemia with calcium acetate treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Maintenance of normal serum calcium levels is important for maternal and fetal well being. Hypercalcemia during pregnancy may increase the risk for maternal and neonatal complications such as stillbirth, preterm delivery, and neonatal hypocalcemia and hypoparathyroidism. Calcium acetate treatment, as recommended, is not expected to harm a fetus if maternal calcium levels are properly monitored during and following treatment. 8.2 Labor and Delivery The effects of calcium acetate on labor and delivery are unknown. 8.3 Nursing Mothers A calcium acetate capsule contains calcium acetate and is excreted in human milk. Human milk feeding by a mother receiving calcium acetate is not expected to harm an infant, provided maternal serum calcium levels are appropriately monitored. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of calcium acetate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

Hyperphosphatemia also plays a role in the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with ESRD. 12.1 Mechanism of Action Calcium acetate, when taken with meals, combines with dietary phosphate to form an insoluble calcium phosphate complex, which is excreted in the feces, resulting in decreased serum phosphorus concentration. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Orally administered calcium acetate from pharmaceutical dosage forms is systemically absorbed up to approximately 40% under fasting conditions and up to approximately 30% under nonfasting conditions. This range represents data from both healthy subjects and renal dialysis patients under various conditions."

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Effectiveness of calcium acetate in decreasing serum phosphorus has been demonstrated in two studies of the calcium acetate solid oral dosage form. Ninety-one patients with end-stage renal disease who were undergoing hemodialysis and were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL) following a 1-week phosphate binder washout period contributed efficacy data to an open-label, non-randomized study. The patients received calcium acetate 667 mg tablets at each meal for a period of 12 weeks. The initial starting dose was 2 tablets per meal for 3 meals a day, and the dose was adjusted as necessary to control serum phosphorus levels. The average final dose after 12 weeks of treatment was 3.4 tablets per meal. Although there was a decrease in serum phosphorus, in the absence of a control group the true magnitude of effect is uncertain. The data presented in Table 2 demonstrate the efficacy of calcium acetate in the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in end-stage renal disease patients. The effects on serum calcium levels are also presented. Table 2: Average Serum Phosphorous and Calcium Levels at Pre-Study, Interim, and Study Completion Time Points Parameter Pre-Study Week 4 b Week 8 Week 12 p-value c Phosphorus (mg/dL) a 7.4 \u00b1 0.17 5.9 \u00b1 0.16 5.6 \u00b1 0.17 5.2 \u00b1 0.17 \u22640.01 Calcium (mg/dL) a 8.9 \u00b1 0.09 9.5 \u00b1 0.10 9.7 \u00b1 0.10 9.7 \u00b1 0.10 \u22640.01 a Values expressed as mean \u00b1 SE. b Ninety-one patients completed at least 6 weeks of the study. c ANOVA of difference in values at pre-study and study completion. There was a 30% decrease in serum phosphorus levels during the 12 week study period (p<0.01). Two-thirds of the decline occurred in the first month of the study. Serum calcium increased 9% during the study mostly in the first month of the study. Treatment with the phosphate binder was discontinued for patients from the open-label study, and those patients whose serum phosphorus exceeded 5.5 mg/dL were eligible for entry into a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Patients were randomized to receive calcium acetate or placebo, and each continued to receive the same number of tablets as had been individually established during the previous study. Following 2 weeks of treatment, patients switched to the alternative therapy for an additional 2 weeks. The phosphate binding effect of calcium acetate is shown in the Table 3. Table 3: Serum Phosphorous and Calcium Levels at Study Initiation and After Completion of Each Treatment Arm Parameter Pre-Study Post-Treatment p-value b Calcium Acetate Placebo Phosphorus (mg/dL) a 7.3 \u00b1 0.18 5.9 \u00b1 0.24 7.8 \u00b1 0.22 <0.01 Calcium (mg/dL) a 8.9 \u00b1 0.11 9.5 \u00b1 0.13 8.8 \u00b1 0.12 <0.01 a Values expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. b ANOVA of calcium acetate vs. placebo after 2 weeks of treatment. Overall, 2 weeks of treatment with calcium acetate statistically significantally (p<0.01) decreased serum phosphorus by a mean of 19% and increased serum calcium by a statistically significant (p<0.01) but clinically unimportant mean of 7%."

        "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended starting dosage for adults is 49 mg/51 mg orally twice daily. The target maintenance dose is 97 mg/103mg orally twice daily. ( 2.2 ) Adjust adult doses every 2 to 4 weeks to the target maintenance dose, as tolerated by the patient. ( 2.2 ) For pediatric patients, see the Full Prescribing Information for recommended dosage, titrations, preparation and administration instructions. ( 2.3 , 2.4 , 2.5 ) Reduce starting dose to half the usually recommended starting dosage for: patients not currently taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) or previously taking a low dose of these agents. ( 2.6 ) patients with severe renal impairment. ( 2.7 ) patients with moderate hepatic impairment. ( 2.8 ) 2.1 General Considerations ENTRESTO is contraindicated with concomitant use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. If switching from an ACE inhibitor to ENTRESTO allow a washout period of 36 hours between administration of the two drugs [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1)] . 2.2 Adult Heart Failure The recommended starting dose of ENTRESTO is 49/51 mg orally twice-daily. Double the dose of ENTRESTO after 2 to 4 weeks to the target maintenance dose of 97/103 mg twice daily, as tolerated by the patient. 2.3 Pediatric Heart Failure For the recommended dosage for pediatric patients aged 1 year and older, refer to Table 1 if using the tablets, or Table 2 if using the oral pellets. Take the recommended dose orally twice daily. Adjust pediatric patient doses every 2 weeks, as tolerated by the patient.

ENTRESTO 800 mg/200 mL oral suspension can be prepared in a concentration of 4 mg/mL (sacubitril/valsartan 1.96/2.04 mg/mL). Use ENTRESTO 49/51 mg tablets in the preparation of the suspension. To make an 800 mg/200 mL (4 mg/mL) oral suspension, transfer eight tablets of ENTRESTO 49/51 mg film-coated tablets into a mortar. Crush the tablets into a fine powder using a pestle. Add 60 mL of Ora-Plus \u00ae into the mortar and triturate gently with pestle for 10 minutes, to form a uniform suspension. Add 140 mL of Ora-Sweet \u00ae SF into mortar and triturate with pestle for another 10 minutes, to form a uniform suspension. Transfer the entire contents from the mortar into a clean 200 mL amber colored PET or glass bottle. Place a press-in bottle adapter and close the bottle with a child resistant cap. The oral suspension can be stored for up to 15 days. Do not store above 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) and do not refrigerate. Shake before each use. * Ora-Sweet SF \u00ae and Ora-Plus \u00ae are registered trademarks of Paddock Laboratories, Inc. 2.5 Preparation and Administration of Oral Pellets ENTRESTO SPRINKLE are oral pellets contained within capsules. Do not swallow the capsules. Do not chew or crush the oral pellets. ENTRESTO SPRINKLE can also be substituted in patients unable to swallow tablets. Use the entire contents of the capsules to achieve the dose. To administer ENTRESTO oral pellets, open the capsule and sprinkle the full content onto 1 to 2 teaspoons of soft food. Consume the food containing the oral pellets immediately after adding them. Empty capsule shells must be discarded after use and not swallowed. Do not administer ENTRESTO oral pellets via nasogastric, gastrostomy, or other enteral tubes because it may cause obstruction of enteral tubes. 2.6 Dose Adjustment for Patients Not Taking an ACE inhibitor or ARB or Previously Taking Low Doses of These Agents In patients not currently taking an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) and for patients previously taking low doses of these agents, start ENTRESTO at half the usually recommended starting dose. After initiation, increase the dose every 2 to 4 weeks in adults and every 2 weeks in pediatric patients to follow the recommended dose escalation thereafter [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)] . Note: Initiate pediatric patients weighing 40 to 50 kg who meet this criterion at 0.8 mg/kg twice daily using the oral suspension or oral pellets [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4, 2.5)] . 2.7 Dose Adjustment for Severe Renal Impairment In adults and pediatric patients with severe renal impairment estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), start ENTRESTO at half the usually recommended starting dose. After initiation, increase the dose to follow the recommended dose escalation thereafter [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)] . Note: Initiate pediatric patients weighing 40 to 50 kg who meet this criterion at 0.8 mg/kg twice daily using the oral suspension or oral pellets [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4, 2.5)] . No starting dose adjustment is needed for mild or moderate renal impairment. 2.8 Dose Adjustment for Hepatic Impairment In adults and pediatric patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B classification), start ENTRESTO at half the usually recommended starting dose. After initiation, increase the dose to follow the recommended dose escalation thereafter [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)] . Note: Initiate pediatric patients weighing 40 to 50 kg who meet this criterion at 0.8 mg/kg twice daily using the oral suspension or oral pellets [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4, 2.5)] .

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Observe for signs and symptoms of angioedema and hypotension. ( 5.2 , 5.3 ) Monitor renal function and potassium in susceptible patients. ( 5.4 , 5.5 ) 5.1 Fetal Toxicity ENTRESTO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. When pregnancy is detected, consider alternative drug treatment and discontinue ENTRESTO. However, if there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system, and if the drug is considered lifesaving for the mother, advise a pregnant woman of the potential risk to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] . 5.2 Angioedema ENTRESTO may cause angioedema [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . If angioedema occurs, discontinue ENTRESTO immediately, provide appropriate therapy, and monitor for airway compromise. ENTRESTO must not be re-administered. In cases of confirmed angioedema where swelling has been confined to the face and lips, the condition has generally resolved without treatment, although antihistamines have been useful in relieving symptoms. Angioedema associated with laryngeal edema may be fatal. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx, likely to cause airway obstruction, administer appropriate therapy, e.g., subcutaneous epinephrine/adrenaline solution 1:1000 (0.3 mL to 0.5 mL) and take measures necessary to ensure maintenance of a patent airway. ENTRESTO has been associated with a higher rate of angioedema in Black than in non-Black patients. Patients with a prior history of angioedema may be at increased risk of angioedema with ENTRESTO [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . ENTRESTO must not be used in patients with a known history of angioedema related to previous ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy [see Contraindications (4)] . ENTRESTO should not be used in patients with hereditary angioedema. 5.3 Hypotension ENTRESTO lowers blood pressure and may cause symptomatic hypotension [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as volume- and/or salt-depleted patients (e.g., those being treated with high doses of diuretics), are at greater risk. Correct volume or salt depletion prior to administration of ENTRESTO or start at a lower dose. If hypotension occurs, consider dose adjustment of diuretics, concomitant antihypertensive drugs, and treatment of other causes of hypotension (e.g., hypovolemia). If hypotension persists despite such measures, reduce the dosage or temporarily discontinue ENTRESTO. Permanent discontinuation of therapy is usually not required. 5.4 Impaired Renal Function As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), decreases in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with ENTRESTO [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . In patients whose renal function depends upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g., patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria, progressive azotemia and, rarely, acute renal failure and death. Closely monitor serum creatinine, and down-titrate or interrupt ENTRESTO in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . As with all drugs that affect the RAAS, ENTRESTO may increase blood urea and serum creatinine levels in patients with bilateral or unilateral renal artery stenosis.

Monitor serum potassium periodically and treat appropriately, especially in patients with risk factors for hyperkalemia such as severe renal impairment, diabetes, hypoaldosteronism, or a high potassium diet.

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation at 1-888-669-6682 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 6,622 heart failure patients were treated with ENTRESTO in the PARADIGM-HF (vs. enalapril) and PARAGON-HF (vs. valsartan) clinical trials. Of these, 5,085 were exposed for at least 1 year. Adult Heart Failure In PARADIGM-HF, patients were required to complete sequential enalapril and ENTRESTO run-in periods of (median) 15 and 29 days, respectively, prior to entering the randomized double-blind period comparing ENTRESTO and enalapril. During the enalapril run-in period, 1,102 patients (10.5%) were permanently discontinued from the study, 5.6% because of an adverse event, most commonly renal dysfunction (1.7%), hyperkalemia (1.7%) and hypotension (1.4%). During the ENTRESTO run-in period, an additional 10.4% of patients permanently discontinued treatment, 5.9% because of an adverse event, most commonly renal dysfunction (1.8%), hypotension (1.7%) and hyperkalemia (1.3%). Because of this run-in design, the adverse reaction rates described below are lower than expected in practice. In the double-blind period, safety was evaluated in 4,203 patients treated with ENTRESTO and 4,229 treated with enalapril. In PARADIGM-HF, patients randomized to ENTRESTO received treatment for up to 4.3 years, with a median duration of exposure of 24 months; 3,271 patients were treated for more than one year. Discontinuation of therapy because of an adverse event during the double-blind period occurred in 450 (10.7%) of ENTRESTO-treated patients and 516 (12.2%) of patients receiving enalapril. Adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of greater than or equal to 5% in patients who were treated with ENTRESTO in the double-blind period of PARADIGM-HF are shown in Table 3. In PARADIGM-HF, the incidence of angioedema was 0.1% in both the enalapril and ENTRESTO run-in periods. In the double-blind period, the incidence of angioedema was higher in patients treated with ENTRESTO than enalapril (0.5% and 0.2%, respectively). The incidence of angioedema in Black patients was 2.4% with ENTRESTO and 0.5% with enalapril [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Orthostasis was reported in 2.1% of patients treated with ENTRESTO compared to 1.1% of patients treated with enalapril during the double-blind period of PARADIGM-HF. Falls were reported in 1.9% of patients treated with ENTRESTO compared to 1.3% of patients treated with enalapril.

Pediatric Heart Failure The adverse reactions observed in pediatric patients 1 year to less than 18 years old who received treatment with ENTRESTO were consistent with those observed in adult patients. Laboratory Abnormalities Hemoglobin and Hematocrit Decreases in hemoglobin/hematocrit of greater than 20% were observed in approximately 5% of both ENTRESTO- and enalapril-treated patients in the double-blind period in PARADIGM-HF. Decreases in hemoglobin/hematocrit of greater than 20% were observed in approximately 7% of ENTRESTO-treated patients and 9% of valsartan-treated patients in the double-blind period in PARAGON-HF. Serum Creatinine During the double-blind period in PARADIGM-HF, approximately 16% of both ENTRESTO- and enalapril-treated patients had increases in serum creatinine of greater than 50%. During the double-blind period in PARAGON-HF, approximately 17% of ENTRESTO-treated patients and 21% of valsartan-treated patients had increases in serum creatinine of greater than 50%. Serum Potassium During the double-blind period of PARADIGM-HF, approximately 16% of both ENTRESTO- and enalapril-treated patients had potassium concentrations greater than 5.5 mEq/L. During the double-blind period of PARAGON-HF, approximately 18% of ENTRESTO-treated patients and 20% of valsartan-treated patients had potassium concentrations greater than 5.5 mEq/L. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported in postmarketing experience.

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended. ( 8.2 ) Severe Hepatic Impairment: Use not recommended. ( 2.8 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary ENTRESTO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death ( see Clinical Considerations ). Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. In animal reproduction studies, ENTRESTO treatment during organogenesis resulted in increased embryo-fetal lethality in rats and rabbits and teratogenicity in rabbits ( see Data ). When pregnancy is detected, consider alternative drug treatment and discontinue ENTRESTO. However, if there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system, and if the drug is considered lifesaving for the mother, advise a pregnant woman of the potential risk to the fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Oligohydramnios in pregnant women who use drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy can result in the following: reduced fetal renal function leading to anuria and renal failure, fetal lung hypoplasia, skeletal deformations, including skull hypoplasia, hypotension, and death. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of gestation. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. If oligohydramnios is observed, consider alternative drug treatment. Closely observe neonates with histories of in utero exposure to ENTRESTO for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia. In neonates with a history of in utero exposure to ENTRESTO, if oliguria or hypotension occurs, support blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and replacing renal function. Data Animal Data ENTRESTO treatment during organogenesis resulted in increased embryo-fetal lethality in rats at doses greater than or equal to 49 mg sacubitril/51 mg valsartan/kg/day (less than or equal to 0.06 [LBQ657, the active metabolite] and 0.72 [valsartan]-fold the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 97/103 mg twice-daily on the basis of the area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve [AUC]) and rabbits at doses greater than or equal to 5 mg sacubitril/5 mg valsartan/kg/day (2-fold and 0.03-fold the MRHD on the basis of valsartan and LBQ657 AUC, respectively). ENTRESTO is teratogenic based on a low incidence of fetal hydrocephaly, associated with maternally toxic doses, which was observed in rabbits at an ENTRESTO dose of greater than or equal to 5 mg sacubitril/5 mg valsartan/kg/day. The adverse embryo-fetal effects of ENTRESTO are attributed to the angiotensin receptor antagonist activity. Pre- and postnatal development studies in rats at sacubitril doses up to 750 mg/kg/day (2.2-fold the MRHD on the basis of LBQ657 AUC) and valsartan at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day (0.86-fold the MRHD on the basis of AUC) indicate that treatment with ENTRESTO during organogenesis, gestation and lactation may affect pup development and survival. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of sacubitril/valsartan in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Sacubitril/valsartan is present in rat milk ( see Data ). Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from exposure to sacubitril/valsartan, advise a nursing woman that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ENTRESTO. Data Following an oral dose (15 mg sacubitril/15 mg valsartan/kg) of [ 14 C] ENTRESTO to lactating rats, transfer of LBQ657 into milk was observed. After a single oral administration of 3 mg/kg [ 14 C] valsartan to lactating rats, transfer of valsartan into milk was observed. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ENTRESTO have been established for the treatment of heart failure in pediatric patients 1 year to less than 18 years. Use of ENTRESTO was evaluated in a multinational, randomized, double-blind trial comparing ENTRESTO and enalapril in 375 patients aged 1 month to less than 18 years (ENTRESTO n = 187; Enalapril n = 188) (PANORAMA-HF) [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] . The safety profile in pediatric patients (1 year to less than 18 years) receiving ENTRESTO was similar to that seen in adult patients. Limited safety and efficacy data in patients aged 1 month to less than 1 year were inadequate to support conclusions on safety and efficacy in this age group. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Sacubitril given orally to juvenile rats from postnatal day (PND) 7 to PND 35 or PND 70 (an age approximately equivalent to neonatal through pre-pubertal development or adulthood in humans) at doses greater than or equal to 400 mg/kg/day (approximately 2-fold the AUC exposure to the active metabolite of sacubitril, LBQ657, at an ENTRESTO pediatric clinical dose of 3.1 mg/kg twice daily) resulted in decreases in body weight, bone length, and bone mass. The decrease in body weight was transient from PND 10 to PND 20 and the effects for most bone parameters were reversible after treatment stopped. Exposure at the No-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Level (NOAEL) of 100 mg/kg/day was approximately 0.5-fold the AUC exposure to LBQ657 at the 3.1 mg/kg twice daily dose of ENTRESTO. The mechanism underlying bone effects in rats and the translatability to pediatric patients are unknown. Valsartan given orally to juvenile rats from PND 7 to PND 70 (an age approximately equivalent to neonatal through adulthood in humans) produced persistent, irreversible kidney damage at all dose levels. Exposure at the lowest tested dose of 1 mg/kg/day was approximately 0.2-fold the exposure at 3.1 mg/kg twice daily dose of ENTRESTO based on AUC. These kidney effects in neonatal rats represent expected exaggerated pharmacological effects that are observed if rats are treated during the first 13 days of life. This period coincides with 36 weeks of gestation in humans, which could occasionally extend up to 44 weeks after conception in humans. In humans, nephrogenesis is thought to be complete around birth; however, maturation of other aspects of kidney function (such as glomerular filtration and tubular function) may continue until approximately 2 years of age. It is unknown whether post-natal use of valsartan before maturation of renal function is complete has long-term deleterious effects on the kidney. 8.5 Geriatric Use There were 4,143 and 3,971 heart failure patients 65 years of age and older in PARADIGM-HF and PARAGON-HF, respectively [see Clinical Studies (14)] . Of the total number of ENTRESTO-treated patients, 2,087 (49.6%) and 1,995 (82.9%) were 65 years of age and older, while 786 (18.7%) and 1,100 (45.7%) were 75 years of age and older in PARADIGM-HF and PARAGON-HF, respectively. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of ENTRESTO have been observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger adult patients in either study. No relevant pharmacokinetic differences have been observed in elderly (\u2265 65 years) or very elderly (\u2265 75 years) patients compared to the overall population [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is required when administering ENTRESTO to patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A classification). Half of the starting dose is recommended in adult and pediatric patients with heart failure and with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B classification). The use of ENTRESTO in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C classification) is not recommended, as no studies have been conducted in these patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 8.7 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild (eGFR 60 to 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) to moderate (eGFR 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment. Half of the starting dose is recommended in adult and pediatric patients with heart failure and with severe renal impairment (eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ).

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action ENTRESTO contains a neprilysin inhibitor, sacubitril, and an angiotensin receptor blocker, valsartan. ENTRESTO inhibits neprilysin (neutral endopeptidase; NEP) via LBQ657, the active metabolite of the prodrug sacubitril, and blocks the angiotensin II type-1 (AT 1 ) receptor via valsartan. The cardiovascular and renal effects of ENTRESTO in heart failure patients are attributed to the increased levels of peptides that are degraded by neprilysin, such as natriuretic peptides, by LBQ657, and the simultaneous inhibition of the effects of angiotensin II by valsartan. Valsartan inhibits the effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the AT 1 receptor, and also inhibits angiotensin II-dependent aldosterone release. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamic effects of ENTRESTO were evaluated after single and multiple dose administrations in healthy subjects and in patients with heart failure, and are consistent with simultaneous neprilysin inhibition and renin-angiotensin system blockade. In a 7-day valsartan-controlled study in patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), administration of ENTRESTO resulted in a significant non-sustained increase in natriuresis, increased urine cGMP, and decreased plasma MR-proANP and NT-proBNP compared to valsartan. In a 21-day study in HFrEF patients, ENTRESTO significantly increased urine ANP and cGMP and plasma cGMP, and decreased plasma NT-proBNP, aldosterone and endothelin-1. ENTRESTO also blocked the AT 1 -receptor as evidenced by increased plasma renin activity and plasma renin concentrations. In PARADIGM-HF, ENTRESTO decreased plasma NT-proBNP (not a neprilysin substrate) and increased plasma BNP (a neprilysin substrate) and urine cGMP compared with enalapril. In PARAMOUNT, a randomized, double-blind, 36-week study in patients with heart failure with LVEF greater than or equal to 45% comparing 97/103 mg of ENTRESTO (n=149) to 160 mg of valsartan (n =152) twice-daily, ENTRESTO decreased NT-proBNP by 17% while valsartan increased NT-proBNP by 8% at Week 12 (p = 0.005). In PARAGON-HF, ENTRESTO decreased NT-proBNP by 24% (Week 16) and 19% (Week 48) compared to 6% and 3% reductions on valsartan, respectively. In PANORAMA-HF, a reduction in NT-proBNP was observed at Weeks 4 and 12 for ENTRESTO (40% and 50%) compared to baseline. The NT-proBNP levels continued to decrease over the duration of the study with a reduction of 65% for ENTRESTO at Week 52 compared to baseline. QT Prolongation: In a thorough QTc clinical study in healthy male subjects, single doses of ENTRESTO 194 mg sacubitril/206 mg valsartan and 583 mg sacubitril/617 mg valsartan had no effect on cardiac repolarization. Amyloid-\u03b2: Neprilysin is one of multiple enzymes involved in the clearance of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) from the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Administration of ENTRESTO 194 mg sacubitril/206 mg valsartan once-daily for 2 weeks to healthy subjects was associated with an increase in CSF A\u03b2 1-38 compared to placebo; there were no changes in concentrations of CSF A\u03b2 1-40 or CSF A\u03b2 1-42 . The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13)] . Blood Pressure: Addition of a 50 mg single dose of sildenafil to ENTRESTO at steady state (194 mg sacubitril/206 mg valsartan once daily for 5 days) in patients with hypertension was associated with additional blood pressure (BP) reduction (approximately 5/4 mmHg, systolic/diastolic BP) compared to administration of ENTRESTO alone. Co-administration of ENTRESTO did not significantly alter the BP effect of intravenous nitroglycerin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration, ENTRESTO dissociates into sacubitril and valsartan. Sacubitril is further metabolized to LBQ657. The peak plasma concentrations of sacubitril, LBQ657, and valsartan are reached in 0.5 hours, 2 hours, and 1.5 hours, respectively. The oral absolute bioavailability of sacubitril is estimated to be greater than or equal to 60%. The valsartan in ENTRESTO is more bioavailable than the valsartan in other marketed tablet formulations; 26 mg, 51 mg, and 103 mg of valsartan in ENTRESTO is equivalent to 40 mg, 80 mg, and 160 mg of valsartan in other marketed tablet formulations, respectively. Following twice-daily dosing of ENTRESTO, steady-state levels of sacubitril, LBQ657, and valsartan are reached in 3 days. At steady state, sacubitril and valsartan do not accumulate significantly, whereas LBQ657 accumulates by 1.6-fold. ENTRESTO administration with food has no clinically significant effect on the systemic exposures of sacubitril, LBQ657, or valsartan. Although there is a decrease in exposure to valsartan when ENTRESTO is administered with food, this decrease is not accompanied by a clinically significant reduction in the therapeutic effect. ENTRESTO can therefore be administered with or without food. Distribution Sacubitril, LBQ657 and valsartan are highly bound to plasma proteins (94% to 97%). Based on the comparison of plasma and CSF exposures, LBQ657 crosses the blood brain barrier to a limited extent (0.28%). The average apparent volumes of distribution of valsartan and sacubitril are 75 and 103 L, respectively. Metabolism Sacubitril is readily converted to LBQ657 by esterases; LBQ657 is not further metabolized to a significant extent. Valsartan is minimally metabolized; only about 20% of the dose is recovered as metabolites. A hydroxyl metabolite has been identified in plasma at low concentrations (less than 10%). Elimination Following oral administration, 52% to 68% of sacubitril (primarily as LBQ657) and approximately 13% of valsartan and its metabolites are excreted in urine; 37% to 48% of sacubitril (primarily as LBQ657), and 86% of valsartan and its metabolites are excreted in feces. Sacubitril, LBQ657, and valsartan are eliminated from plasma with a mean elimination half-life (T 1/2 ) of approximately 1.4 hours, 11.5 hours, and 9.9 hours, respectively. Linearity/Nonlinearity The pharmacokinetics of sacubitril, LBQ657, and valsartan were linear over an ENTRESTO dose range of 24 mg sacubitril/26 mg valsartan to 194 mg sacubitril/206 mg valsartan. Drug Interactions: Effect of Co-administered Drugs on ENTRESTO: Because CYP450 enzyme-mediated metabolism of sacubitril and valsartan is minimal, coadministration with drugs that impact CYP450 enzymes is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of ENTRESTO. Dedicated drug interaction studies demonstrated that coadministration of furosemide, warfarin, digoxin, carvedilol, a combination of levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol, amlodipine, omeprazole, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), metformin, atorvastatin, and sildenafil, did not alter the systemic exposure to sacubitril, LBQ657 or valsartan. Effect of ENTRESTO on Co-administered Drugs: In vitro data indicate that sacubitril inhibits OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 transporters. The effects of ENTRESTO on the pharmacokinetics of coadministered drugs are summarized in Figure 1.

Pediatric Patients: The pharmacokinetics of ENTRESTO were evaluated in pediatric heart failure patients 1 to less than 18 years old administered oral doses of 0.8 mg/kg and 3.1 mg/kg of ENTRESTO.

      "mechanism_of_action": [
        "12.1 Mechanism of Action ENTRESTO contains a neprilysin inhibitor, sacubitril, and an angiotensin receptor blocker, valsartan. ENTRESTO inhibits neprilysin (neutral endopeptidase; NEP) via LBQ657, the active metabolite of the prodrug sacubitril, and blocks the angiotensin II type-1 (AT 1 ) receptor via valsartan. The cardiovascular and renal effects of ENTRESTO in heart failure patients are attributed to the increased levels of peptides that are degraded by neprilysin, such as natriuretic peptides, by LBQ657, and the simultaneous inhibition of the effects of angiotensin II by valsartan. Valsartan inhibits the effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the AT 1 receptor, and also inhibits angiotensin II-dependent aldosterone release."

      "pharmacodynamics": [
        "12.2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamic effects of ENTRESTO were evaluated after single and multiple dose administrations in healthy subjects and in patients with heart failure, and are consistent with simultaneous neprilysin inhibition and renin-angiotensin system blockade. In a 7-day valsartan-controlled study in patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), administration of ENTRESTO resulted in a significant non-sustained increase in natriuresis, increased urine cGMP, and decreased plasma MR-proANP and NT-proBNP compared to valsartan. In a 21-day study in HFrEF patients, ENTRESTO significantly increased urine ANP and cGMP and plasma cGMP, and decreased plasma NT-proBNP, aldosterone and endothelin-1. ENTRESTO also blocked the AT 1 -receptor as evidenced by increased plasma renin activity and plasma renin concentrations. In PARADIGM-HF, ENTRESTO decreased plasma NT-proBNP (not a neprilysin substrate) and increased plasma BNP (a neprilysin substrate) and urine cGMP compared with enalapril. In PARAMOUNT, a randomized, double-blind, 36-week study in patients with heart failure with LVEF greater than or equal to 45% comparing 97/103 mg of ENTRESTO (n=149) to 160 mg of valsartan (n =152) twice-daily, ENTRESTO decreased NT-proBNP by 17% while valsartan increased NT-proBNP by 8% at Week 12 (p = 0.005). In PARAGON-HF, ENTRESTO decreased NT-proBNP by 24% (Week 16) and 19% (Week 48) compared to 6% and 3% reductions on valsartan, respectively.

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Dosing in clinical trials was based on the total amount of both components of ENTRESTO, i.e., 24/26 mg, 49/51 mg, and 97/103 mg were referred to as 50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg, respectively. 14.1 Adult Heart Failure PARADIGM-HF PARADIGM-HF was a multinational, randomized, double-blind trial comparing ENTRESTO and enalapril in 8,442 adult patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure (NYHA class II\u2013IV) and systolic dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction \u2264 40%). Patients had to have been on an ACE inhibitor or ARB for at least four weeks and on maximally tolerated doses of beta-blockers. Patients with a systolic blood pressure of less than 100 mmHg at screening were excluded. The primary objective of PARADIGM-HF was to determine whether ENTRESTO, a combination of sacubitril and an RAS inhibitor (valsartan), was superior to an RAS inhibitor (enalapril) alone in reducing the risk of the combined endpoint of cardiovascular (CV) death or hospitalization for heart failure (HF). After discontinuing their existing ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy, patients entered sequential single-blind run-in periods during which they received enalapril 10 mg twice-daily, followed by ENTRESTO 100 mg twice-daily, increasing to 200 mg twice-daily. Patients who successfully completed the sequential run-in periods were randomized to receive either ENTRESTO 200 mg (N = 4,209) twice-daily or enalapril 10 mg (N = 4,233) twice-daily. The primary endpoint was the first event in the composite of CV death or hospitalization for HF. The median follow-up duration was 27 months and patients were treated for up to 4.3 years. The population was 66% Caucasian, 18% Asian, and 5% Black; the mean age was 64 years and 78% were male. At randomization, 70% of patients were NYHA Class II, 24% were NYHA Class III, and 0.7% were NYHA Class IV. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 29%. The underlying cause of heart failure was coronary artery disease in 60% of patients; 71% had a history of hypertension, 43% had a history of myocardial infarction, 37% had an eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73m 2 , and 35% had diabetes mellitus. Most patients were taking beta-blockers (94%), mineralocorticoid antagonists (58%), and diuretics (82%). Few patients had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillator (CRT-D) (15%). PARADIGM-HF demonstrated that ENTRESTO, a combination of sacubitril and an RAS inhibitor (valsartan), was superior to a RAS inhibitor (enalapril), in reducing the risk of the combined endpoint of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure, based on a time-to-event analysis (hazard ratio [HR] 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73, 0.87, p < 0.0001). The treatment effect reflected a reduction in both cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization; see Table 4 and Figure 3. Sudden death accounted for 45% of cardiovascular deaths, followed by pump failure, which accounted for 26%. ENTRESTO also improved overall survival (HR 0.84; 95% CI [0.76, 0.93], p = 0.0009) (Table 4). This finding was driven entirely by a lower incidence of cardiovascular mortality on ENTRESTO.

The results of the primary composite endpoint were consistent across the subgroups examined (Figure 4).

Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. PARAGON-HF PARAGON-HF, was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial comparing ENTRESTO and valsartan in 4,796 adult patients with symptomatic heart failure with left ventricular ejection fraction greater than or equal to 45%, and structural heart disease [either left atrial enlargement (LAE) or left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)]. Patients with a systolic blood pressure of less than 110 mmHg and patients with any prior echocardiographic LVEF less than 40% at screening were excluded. The primary objective of PARAGON-HF was to determine whether ENTRESTO reduced the rate of the composite endpoint of total (first and recurrent) heart failure (HF) hospitalizations and cardiovascular (CV) death. After discontinuing their existing ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy, patients entered sequential single-blind run-in periods during which they received valsartan 80 mg twice-daily, followed by ENTRESTO 100 mg twice-daily. Patients on prior low doses of an ACEi or ARB began the run-in period receiving valsartan 40 mg twice-daily for 1 to 2 weeks. Patients who successfully completed the sequential run-in periods were randomized to receive either ENTRESTO 200 mg (N = 2,419) twice-daily or valsartan 160 mg (N = 2,403) twice-daily. The median follow-up duration was 35 months and patients were treated for up to 4.7 years. The population was 81% Caucasian, 13% Asian, and 2% Black; the mean age was 73 years and 52% were female. At randomization, 77% of patients were NYHA Class II, 19% were NYHA Class III, and 0.4% were NYHA Class IV. The median left ventricular ejection fraction was 57%. The underlying cause of heart failure was of ischemic etiology in 36% of patients. Furthermore, 96% had a history of hypertension, 23% had a history of myocardial infarction, 46% had an eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and 43% had diabetes mellitus. Most patients were taking beta-blockers (80%) and diuretics (95%). PARAGON-HF demonstrated that ENTRESTO had a numerical reduction in the rate of the composite endpoint of total (first and recurrent) HF hospitalizations and CV death, based on an analysis using a proportional rates model (rate ratio [RR] 0.87; 95% CI [0.75, 1.01], p = 0.06); see Table 5. The treatment effect was primarily driven by the reduction in total HF hospitalizations in patients randomized to ENTRESTO (RR 0.85; 95% CI [0.72, 1.00]).

Patients with systemic right ventricle, single ventricle, restrictive cardiomyopathy or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were excluded from the trial. Efficacy of ENTRESTO in patients less than 1 year old was not established. At Week 52, there were 144 ENTRESTO and 133 enalapril patients with a post-baseline assessment of NT-proBNP. The estimated least squares mean percent reduction from baseline in NT-proBNP was 65% and 62% in the ENTRESTO and enalapril groups, respectively. While the between-group difference was not nominally statistically significant, the reductions for ENTRESTO and enalapril were larger than what was seen in adults; these reductions did not appear to be attributable to post-baseline changes in background therapy. Because ENTRESTO improved outcomes and reduced NT-proBNP in adults in PARADIGM-HF, the effect on NT-proBNP was the basis to infer improved cardiovascular outcomes in pediatric patients."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist opioid analgesics: Avoid use with OXYCONTIN because they may reduce analgesic effect of OXYCONTIN or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. ( 7.4 ) 7.1 CNS Depressants The concomitant use of OXYCONTIN and other CNS depressants including sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other opioids, and alcohol can increase the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, or death. Monitor patients receiving CNS depressants and OXYCONTIN for signs of respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension. When combined therapy with any of the above medications is considered, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . 7.2 Muscle Relaxants Oxycodone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of true skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Monitor patients receiving muscle relaxants and OXYCONTIN for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected. 7.3 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and 2D6 Because the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of oxycodone, drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may cause decreased clearance of oxycodone which could lead to an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations and result in increased or prolonged opioid effects. These effects could me more pronounced with concomitant use of CYP2D6 and 3A4 inhibitors. If co-administration with OXYCONTIN is necessary, monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Inducers of CYP3A4 CYP450 3A4 inducers may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. If co-administration with OXYCONTIN is necessary, monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved. After stopping the treatment of a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the oxycodone plasma concentration will increase which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic and adverse effects, and may cause serious respiratory depression [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.4 Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) and partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of oxycodone or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics in patients receiving OXYCONTIN. 7.5 Diuretics Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Opioids may also lead to acute retention of urine by causing spasm of the sphincter of the bladder, particularly in men with enlarged prostates. 7.6 Anticholinergics Anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with opioid analgesics may result in increased risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when OXYCONTIN is used concurrently with anticholinergic drugs."

      "geriatric_use": [
        "8.5 Geriatric Use In controlled pharmacokinetic studies in elderly subjects (greater than 65 years) the clearance of oxycodone was slightly reduced. Compared to young adults, the plasma concentrations of oxycodone were increased approximately 15% [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Of the total number of subjects (445) in clinical studies of oxycodone hydrochloride controlled-release tablets, 148 (33.3%) were age 65 and older (including those age 75 and older) while 40 (9.0%) were age 75 and older. In clinical trials with appropriate initiation of therapy and dose titration, no untoward or unexpected adverse reactions were seen in the elderly patients who received oxycodone hydrochloride controlled-release tablets. Thus, the usual doses and dosing intervals may be appropriate for elderly patients. However, reduce the starting dose to 1/3 to 1/2 the usual dosage in debilitated, non-opioid-tolerant patients. Respiratory depression is the chief risk in elderly or debilitated patients, usually the result of large initial doses in patients who are not tolerant to opioids, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dose of OXYCONTIN cautiously in these patients."

      "pharmacodynamics": [
        "12.2 Pharmacodynamics A single-dose, double-blind, placebo- and dose-controlled study was conducted using OXYCONTIN (10, 20, and 30 mg) in an analgesic pain model involving 182 patients with moderate to severe pain. OXYCONTIN doses of 20 mg and 30 mg produced statistically significant pain reduction compared to placebo. Effects on the Central Nervous System Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in CO 2 tension and to electrical stimulation. Oxycodone depresses the cough reflex by direct effect on the cough center in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia. Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of oxycodone overdose [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Oxycodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Oxycodone may produce release of histamine with or without associated peripheral vasodilation. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of ACTH, cortisol, testosterone, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration \u2013Efficacy Relationships Studies in normal volunteers and patients reveal predictable relationships between oxycodone dosage and plasma oxycodone concentrations, as well as between concentration and certain expected opioid effects, such as pupillary constriction, sedation, overall subjective \u201cdrug effect\u201d, analgesia and feelings of relaxation. The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. As a result, patients must be treated with individualized titration of dosage to the desired effect. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of oxycodone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome and/or the development of analgesic tolerance. Concentration \u2013Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing oxycodone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related side effects. The dose of OXYCONTIN must be individualized because the effective analgesic dose for some patients will be too high to be tolerated by other patients [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] ."

        "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis No animal studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of oxycodone have been conducted. Mutagenesis Oxycodone was genotoxic in the mouse lymphoma assay at concentrations of 50 mcg/mL or greater with metabolic activation and at 400 mcg/mL or greater without metabolic activation. Clastogenicity was observed with oxycodone in the presence of metabolic activation in one chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes at concentrations greater than or equal to 1250 mcg/mL at 24 but not 48 hours of exposure. In a second chromosomal aberration assay with human lymphocytes, no structural clastogenicity was observed either with or without metabolic activation; however, in the absence of metabolic activation, oxycodone increased numerical chromosomal aberrations (polyploidy). Oxycodone was not genotoxic in the following assays: Ames S. typhimurium and E. coli test with and without metabolic activation at concentrations up to 5000 \u00b5g/plate, chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes (in the absence of metabolic activation) at concentrations up to 1500 \u00b5g/mL, and with activation after 48 hours of exposure at concentrations up to 5000 \u00b5g/mL, and in the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in mice (at plasma levels up to 48 \u00b5g/mL). Impairment of Fertility In a study of reproductive performance, rats were administered a once daily gavage dose of the vehicle or oxycodone hydrochloride (0.5, 2, and 8 mg/kg). Male rats were dosed for 28 days before cohabitation with females, during the cohabitation and until necropsy (2-3 weeks post-cohabitation). Females were dosed for 14 days before cohabitation with males, during cohabitation and up to gestation day 6. Oxycodone hydrochloride did not affect reproductive function in male or female rats at any dose tested (\u2264 8 mg/kg/day)."

        "8.2 Labor and Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression in neonates. OXYCONTIN is not recommended for use in women immediately prior to labor, when use of shorter-acting analgesics or other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration and frequency of uterine contractions. However this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilatation, which tends to shorten labor."

      "pharmacokinetics": [
        "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The activity of OXYCONTIN is primarily due to the parent drug oxycodone. OXYCONTIN is designed to provide delivery of oxycodone over 12 hours. Cutting, breaking, chewing, crushing or dissolving OXYCONTIN impairs the controlled-release delivery mechanism and results in the rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. Oxycodone release from OXYCONTIN is pH independent. The oral bioavailability of oxycodone is 60% to 87%. The relative oral bioavailability of oxycodone from OXYCONTIN to that from immediate-release oral dosage forms is 100%. Upon repeated dosing with OXYCONTIN in healthy subjects in pharmacokinetic studies, steady-state levels were achieved within 24-36 hours. Oxycodone is extensively metabolized and eliminated primarily in the urine as both conjugated and unconjugated metabolites. The apparent elimination half-life (t \u00bd ) of oxycodone following the administration of OXYCONTIN was 4.5 hours compared to 3.2 hours for immediate-release oxycodone. Absorption About 60% to 87% of an oral dose of oxycodone reaches the central compartment in comparison to a parenteral dose. This high oral bioavailability is due to low pre-systemic and/or first-pass metabolism. Plasma Oxycodone Concentration over Time Dose proportionality has been established for OXYCONTIN 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, and 80 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 3) . Given the short elimination t \u00bd of oxycodone, steady-state plasma concentrations of oxycodone are achieved within 24-36 hours of initiation of dosing with OXYCONTIN. In a study comparing 10 mg of OXYCONTIN every 12 hours to 5 mg of immediate-release oxycodone every 6 hours, the two treatments were found to be equivalent for AUC and C max , and similar for C min (trough) concentrations.

Distribution Following intravenous administration, the steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) for oxycodone was 2.6 L/kg. Oxycodone binding to plasma protein at 37\u00b0C and a pH of 7.4 was about 45%. Once absorbed, oxycodone is distributed to skeletal muscle, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain. Oxycodone has been found in breast milk [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.3 )] . Metabolism Oxycodone is extensively metabolized by multiple metabolic pathways to produce noroxycodone, oxymorphone and noroxymorphone, which are subsequently glucuronidated. Noroxycodone and noroxymorphone are the major circulating metabolites. CYP3A mediated N -demethylation to noroxycodone is the primary metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated O -demethylation to oxymorphone. Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )] . Noroxycodone exhibits very weak anti-nociceptive potency compared to oxycodone, however, it undergoes further oxidation to produce noroxymorphone, which is active at opioid receptors. Although noroxymorphone is an active metabolite and present at relatively high concentrations in circulation, it does not appear to cross the blood-brain barrier to a significant extent. Oxymorphone is present in the plasma only at low concentrations and undergoes further metabolism to form its glucuronide and noroxymorphone. Oxymorphone has been shown to be active and possessing analgesic activity but its contribution to analgesia following oxycodone administration is thought to be clinically insignificant. Other metabolites (\u03b1- and \u00df-oxycodol, noroxycodol and oxymorphol) may be present at very low concentrations and demonstrate limited penetration into the brain as compared to oxycodone. The enzymes responsible for keto-reduction and glucuronidation pathways in oxycodone metabolism have not been established. Excretion Oxycodone and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the kidney. The amounts measured in the urine have been reported as follows: free and conjugated oxycodone 8.9%, free noroxycodone 23%, free oxymorphone less than 1%, conjugated oxymorphone 10%, free and conjugated noroxymorphone 14%, reduced free and conjugated metabolites up to 18%. The total plasma clearance was approximately 1.4 L/min in adults. Specific Populations Geriatric Use The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15% greater in elderly as compared to young subjects (age 21-45). Gender Across individual pharmacokinetic studies, average plasma oxycodone concentrations for female subjects were up to 25% higher than for male subjects on a body weight-adjusted basis. The reason for this difference is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.8 )] . Renal Impairment Data from a pharmacokinetic study involving 13 patients with mild to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance <60 mL/min) showed peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50% and 20% higher, respectively, and AUC values for oxycodone, noroxycodone, and oxymorphone 60%, 50%, and 40% higher than normal subjects, respectively. This was accompanied by an increase in sedation but not by differences in respiratory rate, pupillary constriction, or several other measures of drug effect. There was an increase in mean elimination t \u00bd for oxycodone of 1 hour. Hepatic Impairment Data from a study involving 24 patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50% and 20% higher, respectively, than healthy subjects. AUC values are 95% and 65% higher, respectively. Oxymorphone peak plasma concentrations and AUC values are lower by 30% and 40%. These differences are accompanied by increases in some, but not other, drug effects. The mean elimination t \u00bd for oxycodone increased by 2.3 hours. Drug-Drug Interactions CYP3A4 Inhibitors CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in noroxycodone formation. Co-administration of OXYCONTIN (10 mg single dose) and the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (200 mg BID) increased oxycodone AUC and C max by 170% and 100%, respectively [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )]. CYP3A4 Inducers A published study showed that the co-administration of rifampin, a drug metabolizing enzyme inducer, decreased oxycodone AUC and C max values by 86% and 63%, respectively [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors Oxycodone is metabolized in part to oxymorphone via CYP2D6. While this pathway may be blocked by a variety of drugs such as certain cardiovascular drugs (e.g., quinidine) and antidepressants (e.g., fluoxetine), such blockade has not been shown to be of clinical significance with OXYCONTIN [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )]."

      "drug_abuse_and_dependence": [
        "9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance OXYCONTIN contains oxycodone, a Schedule II controlled substance with a high potential for abuse similar to other opioids including fentanyl, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, and oxymorphone. OXYCONTIN can be abused and is subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. The high drug content in extended-release formulations adds to the risk of adverse outcomes from abuse and misuse. 9.2 Abuse All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, since use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Drug abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of an over-the-counter or prescription drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects. Drug abuse includes, but is not limited to, the following examples: the use of a prescription or over-the-counter drug to get \u201chigh\u201d, or the use of steroids for performance enhancement and muscle build up. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and include: a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal. \"Drug-seeking\" behavior is very common to addicts and drug abusers. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated claims of loss of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s). \u201cDoctor shopping\u201d (visiting multiple prescribers) to obtain additional prescriptions is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control. Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Physicians should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction. OXYCONTIN, like other opioids, can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful recordkeeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests as required by state law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to reduce abuse of opioid drugs. Risks Specific to Abuse of OXYCONTIN OXYCONTIN is for oral use only. Abuse of OXYCONTIN poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent use of OXYCONTIN with alcohol and other central nervous system depressants. Taking cut, broken, chewed, crushed, or dissolved OXYCONTIN enhances drug release and increases the risk of overdose and death. With parenteral abuse, the inactive ingredients in OXYCONTIN can be expected to result in local tissue necrosis, infection, pulmonary granulomas, and increased risk of endocarditis and valvular heart injury. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases, such as hepatitis and HIV. Abuse Deterrence Studies OXYCONTIN is formulated with inactive ingredients intended to make the tablet more difficult to manipulate for misuse and abuse. For the purposes of describing the results of studies of the abuse-deterrent characteristics of OXYCONTIN resulting from a change in formulation, in this section, the original formulation of OXYCONTIN, which is no longer marketed, will be referred to as \u201coriginal OXYCONTIN\u201d and the reformulated, currently marketed product will be referred to as \u201cOXYCONTIN\". In Vitro Testing In vitro physical and chemical tablet manipulation studies were performed to evaluate the success of different extraction methods in defeating the extended-release formulation. Results support that, relative to original OXYCONTIN, there is an increase in the ability of OXYCONTIN to resist crushing, breaking, and dissolution using a variety of tools and solvents. The results of these studies also support this finding for OXYCONTIN relative to an immediate-release oxycodone. When subjected to an aqueous environment, OXYCONTIN gradually forms a viscous hydrogel (i.e., a gelatinous mass) that resists passage through a needle. Clinical Studies In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 5-period crossover pharmacodynamic study, 30 recreational opioid users with a history of intranasal drug abuse received intranasally administered active and placebo drug treatments. The five treatment arms were finely crushed OXYCONTIN 30 mg tablets, coarsely crushed OXYCONTIN 30 mg tablets, finely crushed original OXYCONTIN 30 mg tablets, powdered oxycodone HCl 30 mg, and placebo. Data for finely crushed OXYCONTIN, finely crushed original OXYCONTIN, and powdered oxycodone HCl are described below. Drug liking was measured on a bipolar drug liking scale of 0 to 100 where 50 represents a neutral response of neither liking nor disliking, 0 represents maximum disliking and 100 represents maximum liking. Response to whether the subject would take the study drug again was also measured on a bipolar scale of 0 to 100 where 50 represents a neutral response, 0 represents the strongest negative response (\u201cdefinitely would not take drug again\u201d) and 100 represents the strongest positive response (\u201cdefinitely would take drug again\u201d). Twenty-seven of the subjects completed the study. Incomplete dosing due to granules falling from the subjects\u2019 nostrils occurred in 34% (n = 10) of subjects with finely crushed OXYCONTIN, compared with 7% (n = 2) of subjects with finely crushed original OXYCONTIN and no subjects with powdered oxycodone HCl. The intranasal administration of finely crushed OXYCONTIN was associated with a numerically lower mean and median drug liking score and a lower mean and median score for take drug again, compared to finely crushed original OXYCONTIN or powdered oxycodone HCl as summarized in Table 2. Table 2: Summary of Maximum Drug Liking (E max ) Data Following Intranasal Administration * Bipolar scales (0 = maximum negative response, 50 = neutral response, 100 = maximum positive response) VAS Scale (100 mm)* OXYCONTIN (finely crushed) Original OXYCONTIN (finely crushed) Oxycodone HCl (powdered) Drug Liking Mean (SE) 80.4 (3.9) 94.0 (2.7) 89.3 (3.1) Median (Range) 88 (36-100) 100 (51-100) 100 (50-100) Take Drug Again Mean (SE) 64.0 (7.1) 89.6 (3.9) 86.6 (4.4) Median (Range) 78 (0-100) 100 (20-100) 100 (0-100) Figure 1 demonstrates a comparison of drug liking for finely crushed OXYCONTIN compared to powdered oxycodone HCl in subjects who received both treatments. The Y-axis represents the percent of subjects attaining a percent reduction in drug liking for OXYCONTIN vs. oxycodone HCl powder greater than or equal to the value on the X-axis. Approximately 44% (n = 12) had no reduction in liking with OXYCONTIN relative to oxycodone HCl. Approximately 56% (n = 15) of subjects had some reduction in drug liking with OXYCONTIN relative to oxycodone HCl. Thirty-three percent (n = 9) of subjects had a reduction of at least 30% in drug liking with OXYCONTIN compared to oxycodone HCl, and approximately 22% (n = 6) of subjects had a reduction of at least 50% in drug liking with OXYCONTIN compared to oxycodone HCl. Figure 1: Percent Reduction Profiles for E max of Drug Liking VAS for OXYCONTIN vs. oxycodone HCl, N=27 Following Intranasal Administration The results of a similar analysis of drug liking for finely crushed OXYCONTIN relative to finely crushed original OXYCONTIN were comparable to the results of finely crushed OXYCONTIN relative to powdered oxycodone HCl. Approximately 43% (n = 12) of subjects had no reduction in liking with OXYCONTIN relative to original OXYCONTIN. Approximately 57% (n = 16) of subjects had some reduction in drug liking, 36% (n = 10) of subjects had a reduction of at least 30% in drug liking, and approximately 29% (n = 8) of subjects had a reduction of at least 50% in drug liking with OXYCONTIN compared to original OXYCONTIN. Summary The in vitro data demonstrate that OXYCONTIN has physicochemical properties expected to make abuse via injection difficult. The data from the clinical study, along with support from the in vitro data, also indicate that OXYCONTIN has physicochemical properties that are expected to reduce abuse via the intranasal route. However, abuse of OXYCONTIN by these routes, as well as by the oral route, is still possible. Additional data, including epidemiological data, when available, may provide further information on the impact of the current formulation of OXYCONTIN on the abuse liability of the drug. Accordingly, this section may be updated in the future as appropriate. OXYCONTIN contains oxycodone, an opioid agonist and Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit, including fentanyl, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, and oxymorphone. OXYCONTIN can be abused and is subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.1 )]. Figure 1 9.3 Dependence Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during chronic opioid therapy. Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs, and may develop at different rates for different effects. Physical dependence results in withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity, e.g., naloxone, nalmefene, mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued opioid usage. OXYCONTIN should not be abruptly discontinued [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. If OXYCONTIN is abruptly discontinued in a physically-dependent patient, an abstinence syndrome may occur. Some or all of the following can characterize this syndrome: restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including: irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] ."

        "8.1 Pregnancy Clinical Considerations Fetal/neonatal adverse reactions Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, such as poor feeding, diarrhea, irritability, tremor, rigidity, and seizures, and manage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Teratogenic Effects - Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. OXYCONTIN should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus. The effect of oxycodone in human reproduction has not been adequately studied. Studies with oral doses of oxycodone hydrochloride in rats up to 8 mg/kg/day and rabbits up to 125 mg/kg/day, equivalent to 0.5 and 15 times an adult human dose of 160 mg/day, respectively on a mg/m 2 basis, did not reveal evidence of harm to the fetus due to oxycodone. In a pre- and postnatal toxicity study, female rats received oxycodone during gestation and lactation. There were no long-term developmental or reproductive effects in the pups [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. Non-Teratogenic Effects Oxycodone hydrochloride was administered orally to female rats during gestation and lactation in a pre- and postnatal toxicity study. There were no drug-related effects on reproductive performance in these females or any long-term developmental or reproductive effects in pups born to these rats. Decreased body weight was found during lactation and the early post-weaning phase in pups nursed by mothers given the highest dose used (6 mg/kg/day, equivalent to approximately 0.4-times an adult human dose of 160 mg/day, on a mg/m 2 basis). However, body weight of these pups recovered."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Interactions with CNS depressants: Concomitant use may cause profound sedation, respiratory depression and death. If coadminstration is required, consider dose reduction of one or both drugs. ( 5.4 ) Elderly, cachectic, debilitated patients, and those with chronic pulmonary disease: Monitor closely because of increased risk for life-threatening respiratory depression. ( 5.5 , 5.6 ) Hypotensive effects: Monitor during dose initiation and titration. ( 5.7 ) Patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of OXYCONTIN in patients with impaired consciousness or coma susceptible to intracranial effects of CO 2 retention. ( 5.8 ) Use with caution in patients who have difficulty swallowing or have underlying GI disorders that may predispose them to obstruction. ( 5.9 ) Concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase opioid effects. ( 5.14 ) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse OXYCONTIN contains oxycodone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, OXYCONTIN exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 )]. As modified-release products such as OXYCONTIN deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of oxycodone present [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 )] . Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed OXYCONTIN. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient\u2019s risk for opioid addiction, abuse or misuse prior to prescribing OXYCONTIN, and monitor all patients receiving OXYCONTIN for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed modified-release opioid formulations such as OXYCONTIN, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of OXYCONTIN along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Abuse, or misuse of OXYCONTIN by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product will result in the uncontrolled delivery of oxycodone and can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage ( 10 )]. Opioid agonists are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing OXYCONTIN. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )] . Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of modified-release opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient\u2019s clinical status [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of OXYCONTIN, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dose increase. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with OXYCONTIN and following dose increases. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of OXYCONTIN are essential [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . Overestimating the OXYCONTIN dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental ingestion of even one dose of OXYCONTIN, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of oxycodone. 5.3 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of OXYCONTIN during pregnancy can result in withdrawal signs in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. 5.4 Interactions with Central Nervous System Depressants Hypotension and profound sedation, coma, or respiratory depression may result if OXYCONTIN is used concomitantly with other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (e.g., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, other opioids). When considering the use of OXYCONTIN in a patient taking a CNS depressant, assess the duration of use of the CNS depressant and the patient\u2019s response, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Additionally, evaluate the patient\u2019s use of alcohol or illicit drugs that can cause CNS depression. If the decision to begin OXYCONTIN therapy is made, start with 1/3 to 1/2 the usual dose of OXYCONTIN, monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression and consider using a lower dose of the concomitant CNS depressant [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.5 Use in Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating OXYCONTIN and when OXYCONTIN is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 5.6 Use in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy and titrating with OXYCONTIN, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of OXYCONTIN may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.7 Hypotensive Effects OXYCONTIN may cause severe hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of OXYCONTIN. In patients with circulatory shock, OXYCONTIN may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of OXYCONTIN in patients with circulatory shock. 5.8 Use in Patients with Head Injury or Increased Intracranial Pressure Monitor patients taking OXYCONTIN who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO 2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors) for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with OXYCONTIN. OXYCONTIN may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO 2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of OXYCONTIN in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.9 Difficulty in Swallowing and Risk for Obstruction in Patients at Risk for a Small Gastrointestinal Lumen There have been post-marketing reports of difficulty in swallowing OXYCONTIN tablets. These reports included choking, gagging, regurgitation and tablets stuck in the throat. Instruct patients not to pre-soak, lick or otherwise wet OXYCONTIN tablets prior to placing in the mouth, and to take one tablet at a time with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth. There have been rare post-marketing reports of cases of intestinal obstruction, and exacerbation of diverticulitis, some of which have required medical intervention to remove the tablet. Patients with underlying GI disorders such as esophageal cancer or colon cancer with a small gastrointestinal lumen are at greater risk of developing these complications. Consider use of an alternative analgesic in patients who have difficulty swallowing and patients at risk for underlying GI disorders resulting in a small gastrointestinal lumen. 5.10 Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions OXYCONTIN is contraindicated in patients with GI obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The oxycodone in OXYCONTIN may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. Opioids may cause increases in the serum amylase. 5.11 Use in Patients with Convulsive or Seizure Disorders The oxycodone in OXYCONTIN may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during OXYCONTIN therapy. 5.12 Avoidance of Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with a full opioid agonist analgesic, including OXYCONTIN. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. When discontinuing OXYCONTIN, gradually taper the dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Do not abruptly discontinue OXYCONTIN. 5.13 Driving and Operating Machinery OXYCONTIN may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of OXYCONTIN and know how they will react to the medication. 5.14 Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of OXYCONTIN, drugs that alter CYP3A4 activity may cause changes in clearance of oxycodone which could lead to changes in oxycodone plasma concentrations. Inhibition of CYP3A4 activity by its inhibitors, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may increase plasma concentrations of oxycodone and prolong opioid effects. CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of oxycodone and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in oxycodone plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. If co-administration is necessary, caution is advised when initiating OXYCONTIN treatment in patients currently taking, or discontinuing, CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.15 Laboratory Monitoring Not every urine drug test for \u201copioids\u201d or \u201copiates\u201d detects oxycodone reliably, especially those designed for in-office use. Further, many laboratories will report urine drug concentrations below a specified \u201ccut-off\u201d value as \u201cnegative\u201d. Therefore, if urine testing for oxycodone is considered in the clinical management of an individual patient, ensure that the sensitivity and specificity of the assay is appropriate, and consider the limitations of the testing used when interpreting results."

        "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION OXYCONTIN 60 mg and 80 mg tablets, a single dose greater than 40 mg, or a total daily dose greater than 80 mg are only for use in patients in whom tolerance to an opioid of comparable potency has been established. ( 2.1 ) For opioid-na\u00efve and opioid non-tolerant patients, initiate with 10 mg tablets orally every 12 hours. ( 2.1 ) Do not abruptly discontinue OXYCONTIN in a physically dependent patient. ( 2.4 ) Tablets must be swallowed intact and are not to be cut, broken, chewed, crushed, or dissolved (risk of potentially fatal dose). ( 2.5 , 5.1 ) OXYCONTIN tablets should be taken one tablet at a time, with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth. ( 2.5 , 5.9 , 17 ) 2.1 Initial Dosing OXYCONTIN should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable in the use of potent opioids for the management of chronic pain. OXYCONTIN 60 mg and 80 mg tablets, a single dose greater than 40 mg, or a total daily dose greater than 80 mg are only for use in patients in whom tolerance to an opioid of comparable potency has been established. Patients considered opioid tolerant are those receiving, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg oral morphine/day, 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl/hour, 30 mg oral oxycodone/day, 8 mg oral hydromorphone/day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone/day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24-72 hours of initiating therapy with OXYCONTIN [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. OXYCONTIN tablets must be taken whole, one tablet at a time, with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )] . Crushing, chewing, or dissolving OXYCONTIN tablets will result in uncontrolled delivery of oxycodone and can lead to overdose or death [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Use of OXYCONTIN as the First Opioid Analgesic Initiate treatment with OXYCONTIN with one 10 mg tablet orally every 12 hours. Use of OXYCONTIN in Patients who are not Opioid Tolerant The starting dose for patients who are not opioid tolerant is OXYCONTIN 10 mg orally every 12 hours. Patients who are opioid tolerant are those receiving, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg oral morphine per day, 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl per hour, 30 mg oral oxycodone per day, 8 mg oral hydromorphone per day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid. Use of higher starting doses in patients who are not opioid tolerant may cause fatal respiratory depression. Conversion from other Oral Oxycodone Formulations to OXYCONTIN Patients receiving other oral oxycodone formulations may be converted to OXYCONTIN by administering one-half of the patient's total daily oral oxycodone dose as OXYCONTIN every 12 hours.Patients receiving other oral oxycodone formulations may be converted to OXYCONTIN by administering one-half of the patient's total daily oral oxycodone dose as OXYCONTIN every 12 hours. Conversion from other Opioids to OXYCONTIN Discontinue all other around-the-clock opioid drugs when OXYCONTIN therapy is initiated. There are no established conversion ratios for conversion from other opioids to OXYCONTIN defined by clinical trials. Discontinue all other around-the-clock opioid drugs when OXYCONTIN therapy is initiated and initiate dosing using OXYCONTIN 10 mg orally every 12 hours. It is safer to underestimate a patient\u2019s 24-hour oral oxycodone requirements and provide rescue medication (e.g., immediate-release opioid) than to overestimate the 24-hour oral oxycodone requirements which could result in adverse reactions. While useful tables of opioid equivalents are readily available, there is substantial inter-patient variability in the relative potency of different opioid drugs and products. Conversion from Methadone to OXYCONTIN Close monitoring is of particular importance when converting from methadone to other opioid agonists. The ratio between methadone and other opioid agonists may vary widely as a function of previous dose exposure. Methadone has a long half-life and can accumulate in the plasma. Conversion from Transdermal Fentanyl to OXYCONTIN Eighteen hours following the removal of the transdermal fentanyl patch, OXYCONTIN treatment can be initiated. Although there has been no systematic assessment of such conversion, a conservative oxycodone dose, approximately 10 mg every 12 hours of OXYCONTIN, should be initially substituted for each 25 mcg/hr fentanyl transdermal patch. Follow the patient closely during conversion from transdermal fentanyl to OXYCONTIN, as there is limited documented experience with this conversion.Eighteen hours following the removal of the transdermal fentanyl patch, OXYCONTIN treatment can be initiated. Although there has been no systematic assessment of such conversion, a conservative oxycodone dose, approximately 10 mg every 12 hours of OXYCONTIN, should be initially substituted for each 25 mcg/hr fentanyl transdermal patch. Follow the patient closely during conversion from transdermal fentanyl to OXYCONTIN, as there is limited documented experience with this conversion. 2.2 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Individually titrate OXYCONTIN to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving OXYCONTIN to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse and misuse. Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. During chronic therapy, periodically reassess the continued need for the use of opioid analgesics. Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require a dose increase of OXYCONTIN or may need rescue medication with an appropriate dose of an immediate-release analgesic. If the level of pain increases after dose stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the OXYCONTIN dose. Because steady-state plasma concentrations are approximated in 1 day, OXYCONTIN dosage may be adjusted every 1 to 2 days. If unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed, the subsequent dose may be reduced. Adjust the dose to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions. There are no well-controlled clinical studies evaluating the safety and efficacy with dosing more frequently than every 12 hours. As a guideline, the total daily oxycodone dose usually can be increased by 25% to 50% of the current dose, each time an increase is clinically indicated.There are no well-controlled clinical studies evaluating the safety and efficacy with dosing more frequently than every 12 hours. As a guideline, the total daily oxycodone dose usually can be increased by 25% to 50% of the current dose, each time an increase is clinically indicated. 2.3 Patients with Hepatic Impairment For patients with hepatic impairment, start dosing patients at 1/3 to 1/2 the usual starting dose followed by careful dose titration [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 2.4 Discontinuation of OXYCONTIN When the patient no longer requires therapy with OXYCONTIN tablets, use a gradual downward titration of the dose to prevent signs and symptoms of withdrawal in the physically dependent patient. Do not abruptly discontinue OXYCONTIN. 2.5 Administration of OXYCONTIN Instruct patients to swallow OXYCONTIN tablets intact. The tablets are not to be crushed, dissolved, or chewed due to the risk of rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Instruct patients to take OXYCONTIN one tablet at a time and with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )]."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Purdue Pharma L.P. at 1-888-726-7535 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of OXYCONTIN was evaluated in double-blind clinical trials involving 713 patients with moderate to severe pain of various etiologies. In open-label studies of cancer pain, 187 patients received OXYCONTIN in total daily doses ranging from 20 mg to 640 mg per day. The average total daily dose was approximately 105 mg per day. OXYCONTIN may increase the risk of serious adverse reactions such as those observed with other opioid analgesics, including respiratory depression, apnea, respiratory arrest, circulatory depression, hypotension, or shock [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . The most common adverse reactions (>5%) reported by patients in clinical trials comparing OXYCONTIN with placebo are shown in Table 1 below: TABLE 1: Common Adverse Reactions (>5%) Adverse Reaction OXYCONTIN (n=227) Placebo (n=45) (%) (%) Constipation (23) (7) Nausea (23) (11) Somnolence (23) (4) Dizziness (13) (9) Pruritus (13) (2) Vomiting (12) (7) Headache (7) (7) Dry Mouth (6) (2) Asthenia (6) - Sweating (5) (2) In clinical trials, the following adverse reactions were reported in patients treated with OXYCONTIN with an incidence between 1% and 5%: Gastrointestinal disorders: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, gastritis General disorders and administration site conditions: chills, fever Metabolism and nutrition disorders: anorexia Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: twitching Psychiatric disorders: abnormal dreams, anxiety, confusion, dysphoria, euphoria, insomnia, nervousness, thought abnormalities Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dyspnea, hiccups Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: rash Vascular disorders: postural hypotension The following adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% of patients involved in clinical trials: Blood and lymphatic system disorders: lymphadenopathy Ear and labyrinth disorders: tinnitus Eye disorders: abnormal vision Gastrointestinal disorders: dysphagia, eructation, flatulence, gastrointestinal disorder, increased appetite, stomatitis General disorders and administration site conditions: withdrawal syndrome (with and without seizures), edema, peripheral edema, thirst, malaise, chest pain, facial edema Injury, poisoning and procedural complications: accidental injury Investigations: ST depression Metabolism and nutrition disorders: dehydration Nervous system disorders: syncope, migraine, abnormal gait, amnesia, hyperkinesia, hypesthesia, hypotonia, paresthesia, speech disorder, stupor, tremor, vertigo, taste perversion Psychiatric disorders: depression, agitation, depersonalization, emotional lability, hallucination Renal and urinary disorders: dysuria, hematuria, polyuria, urinary retention Reproductive system and breast disorders: impotence Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: cough increased, voice alteration Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: dry skin, exfoliative dermatitis 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of controlled-release oxycodone: abuse, addiction, amenorrhea, cholestasis, death, dental caries, increased hepatic enzymes, hyperalgesia, hypogonadism, hyponatremia, ileus, muscular hypertonia, overdose, palpitations (in the context of withdrawal), seizures, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, and urticaria. Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in OXYCONTIN. Advise patients how to recognize such a reaction and when to seek medical attention. In addition to the events listed above, the following have also been reported, potentially due to the swelling and hydrogelling property of the tablet: choking, gagging, regurgitation, tablets stuck in the throat and difficulty swallowing the tablet."

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mothers: Oxycodone has been detected in human milk. Closely monitor infants of nursing women receiving OXYCONTIN. ( 8.3 ) Geriatrics: The initial dose may need to be reduced to 1/3 to 1/2 of the usual doses. ( 8.5 ) Hepatic impairment: Initiate therapy at 1/3 to 1/2 the usual doses and titrate carefully. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Clinical Considerations Fetal/neonatal adverse reactions Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, such as poor feeding, diarrhea, irritability, tremor, rigidity, and seizures, and manage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Teratogenic Effects - Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. OXYCONTIN should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus. The effect of oxycodone in human reproduction has not been adequately studied. Studies with oral doses of oxycodone hydrochloride in rats up to 8 mg/kg/day and rabbits up to 125 mg/kg/day, equivalent to 0.5 and 15 times an adult human dose of 160 mg/day, respectively on a mg/m 2 basis, did not reveal evidence of harm to the fetus due to oxycodone. In a pre- and postnatal toxicity study, female rats received oxycodone during gestation and lactation. There were no long-term developmental or reproductive effects in the pups [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. Non-Teratogenic Effects Oxycodone hydrochloride was administered orally to female rats during gestation and lactation in a pre- and postnatal toxicity study. There were no drug-related effects on reproductive performance in these females or any long-term developmental or reproductive effects in pups born to these rats. Decreased body weight was found during lactation and the early post-weaning phase in pups nursed by mothers given the highest dose used (6 mg/kg/day, equivalent to approximately 0.4-times an adult human dose of 160 mg/day, on a mg/m 2 basis). However, body weight of these pups recovered. 8.2 Labor and Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression in neonates. OXYCONTIN is not recommended for use in women immediately prior to labor, when use of shorter-acting analgesics or other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration and frequency of uterine contractions. However this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilatation, which tends to shorten labor. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Oxycodone has been detected in breast milk. Instruct patients not to undertake nursing while receiving OXYCONTIN. Do not initiate OXYCONTIN therapy while nursing because of the possibility of sedation or respiratory depression in the infant. Withdrawal signs can occur in breast-fed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of OXYCONTIN in pediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In controlled pharmacokinetic studies in elderly subjects (greater than 65 years) the clearance of oxycodone was slightly reduced. Compared to young adults, the plasma concentrations of oxycodone were increased approximately 15% [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Of the total number of subjects (445) in clinical studies of oxycodone hydrochloride controlled-release tablets, 148 (33.3%) were age 65 and older (including those age 75 and older) while 40 (9.0%) were age 75 and older. In clinical trials with appropriate initiation of therapy and dose titration, no untoward or unexpected adverse reactions were seen in the elderly patients who received oxycodone hydrochloride controlled-release tablets. Thus, the usual doses and dosing intervals may be appropriate for elderly patients. However, reduce the starting dose to 1/3 to 1/2 the usual dosage in debilitated, non-opioid-tolerant patients. Respiratory depression is the chief risk in elderly or debilitated patients, usually the result of large initial doses in patients who are not tolerant to opioids, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dose of OXYCONTIN cautiously in these patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment A study of OXYCONTIN in patients with hepatic impairment demonstrated greater plasma concentrations than those seen at equivalent doses in persons with normal hepatic function. Therefore, in the setting of hepatic impairment, start dosing patients at 1/3 to 1/2 the usual starting dose followed by careful dose titration [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.7 Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment, as evidenced by decreased creatinine clearance (<60 mL/min), the concentrations of oxycodone in the plasma are approximately 50% higher than in subjects with normal renal function. Follow a conservative approach to dose initiation and adjust according to the clinical situation [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.8 Gender Differences In pharmacokinetic studies with OXYCONTIN, opioid-na\u00efve females demonstrate up to 25% higher average plasma concentrations and greater frequency of typical opioid adverse events than males, even after adjustment for body weight. The clinical relevance of a difference of this magnitude is low for a drug intended for chronic usage at individualized dosages, and there was no male/female difference detected for efficacy or adverse events in clinical trials."

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxycodone hydrochloride is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of oxycodone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect to analgesia for oxycodone. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. 12.1 Mechanism of Action Central Nervous System The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics A single-dose, double-blind, placebo- and dose-controlled study was conducted using OXYCONTIN (10, 20, and 30 mg) in an analgesic pain model involving 182 patients with moderate to severe pain. OXYCONTIN doses of 20 mg and 30 mg produced statistically significant pain reduction compared to placebo. Effects on the Central Nervous System Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in CO 2 tension and to electrical stimulation. Oxycodone depresses the cough reflex by direct effect on the cough center in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia. Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of oxycodone overdose [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Oxycodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Oxycodone may produce release of histamine with or without associated peripheral vasodilation. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of ACTH, cortisol, testosterone, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration \u2013Efficacy Relationships Studies in normal volunteers and patients reveal predictable relationships between oxycodone dosage and plasma oxycodone concentrations, as well as between concentration and certain expected opioid effects, such as pupillary constriction, sedation, overall subjective \u201cdrug effect\u201d, analgesia and feelings of relaxation. The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. As a result, patients must be treated with individualized titration of dosage to the desired effect. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of oxycodone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome and/or the development of analgesic tolerance. Concentration \u2013Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing oxycodone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related side effects. The dose of OXYCONTIN must be individualized because the effective analgesic dose for some patients will be too high to be tolerated by other patients [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The activity of OXYCONTIN is primarily due to the parent drug oxycodone. OXYCONTIN is designed to provide delivery of oxycodone over 12 hours. Cutting, breaking, chewing, crushing or dissolving OXYCONTIN impairs the controlled-release delivery mechanism and results in the rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. Oxycodone release from OXYCONTIN is pH independent. The oral bioavailability of oxycodone is 60% to 87%. The relative oral bioavailability of oxycodone from OXYCONTIN to that from immediate-release oral dosage forms is 100%. Upon repeated dosing with OXYCONTIN in healthy subjects in pharmacokinetic studies, steady-state levels were achieved within 24-36 hours. Oxycodone is extensively metabolized and eliminated primarily in the urine as both conjugated and unconjugated metabolites. The apparent elimination half-life (t \u00bd ) of oxycodone following the administration of OXYCONTIN was 4.5 hours compared to 3.2 hours for immediate-release oxycodone. Absorption About 60% to 87% of an oral dose of oxycodone reaches the central compartment in comparison to a parenteral dose. This high oral bioavailability is due to low pre-systemic and/or first-pass metabolism. Plasma Oxycodone Concentration over Time Dose proportionality has been established for OXYCONTIN 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, and 80 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 3) . Given the short elimination t \u00bd of oxycodone, steady-state plasma concentrations of oxycodone are achieved within 24-36 hours of initiation of dosing with OXYCONTIN. In a study comparing 10 mg of OXYCONTIN every 12 hours to 5 mg of immediate-release oxycodone every 6 hours, the two treatments were found to be equivalent for AUC and C max , and similar for C min (trough) concentrations.

Distribution Following intravenous administration, the steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) for oxycodone was 2.6 L/kg. Oxycodone binding to plasma protein at 37\u00b0C and a pH of 7.4 was about 45%. Once absorbed, oxycodone is distributed to skeletal muscle, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain. Oxycodone has been found in breast milk [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.3 )] . Metabolism Oxycodone is extensively metabolized by multiple metabolic pathways to produce noroxycodone, oxymorphone and noroxymorphone, which are subsequently glucuronidated. Noroxycodone and noroxymorphone are the major circulating metabolites. CYP3A mediated N -demethylation to noroxycodone is the primary metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated O -demethylation to oxymorphone. Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )] . Noroxycodone exhibits very weak anti-nociceptive potency compared to oxycodone, however, it undergoes further oxidation to produce noroxymorphone, which is active at opioid receptors. Although noroxymorphone is an active metabolite and present at relatively high concentrations in circulation, it does not appear to cross the blood-brain barrier to a significant extent. Oxymorphone is present in the plasma only at low concentrations and undergoes further metabolism to form its glucuronide and noroxymorphone. Oxymorphone has been shown to be active and possessing analgesic activity but its contribution to analgesia following oxycodone administration is thought to be clinically insignificant. Other metabolites (\u03b1- and \u00df-oxycodol, noroxycodol and oxymorphol) may be present at very low concentrations and demonstrate limited penetration into the brain as compared to oxycodone. The enzymes responsible for keto-reduction and glucuronidation pathways in oxycodone metabolism have not been established. Excretion Oxycodone and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the kidney. The amounts measured in the urine have been reported as follows: free and conjugated oxycodone 8.9%, free noroxycodone 23%, free oxymorphone less than 1%, conjugated oxymorphone 10%, free and conjugated noroxymorphone 14%, reduced free and conjugated metabolites up to 18%. The total plasma clearance was approximately 1.4 L/min in adults. Specific Populations Geriatric Use The plasma concentrations of oxycodone are only nominally affected by age, being 15% greater in elderly as compared to young subjects (age 21-45). Gender Across individual pharmacokinetic studies, average plasma oxycodone concentrations for female subjects were up to 25% higher than for male subjects on a body weight-adjusted basis. The reason for this difference is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.8 )] . Renal Impairment Data from a pharmacokinetic study involving 13 patients with mild to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance <60 mL/min) showed peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50% and 20% higher, respectively, and AUC values for oxycodone, noroxycodone, and oxymorphone 60%, 50%, and 40% higher than normal subjects, respectively. This was accompanied by an increase in sedation but not by differences in respiratory rate, pupillary constriction, or several other measures of drug effect. There was an increase in mean elimination t \u00bd for oxycodone of 1 hour. Hepatic Impairment Data from a study involving 24 patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction show peak plasma oxycodone and noroxycodone concentrations 50% and 20% higher, respectively, than healthy subjects. AUC values are 95% and 65% higher, respectively. Oxymorphone peak plasma concentrations and AUC values are lower by 30% and 40%. These differences are accompanied by increases in some, but not other, drug effects. The mean elimination t \u00bd for oxycodone increased by 2.3 hours. Drug-Drug Interactions CYP3A4 Inhibitors CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in noroxycodone formation. Co-administration of OXYCONTIN (10 mg single dose) and the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (200 mg BID) increased oxycodone AUC and C max by 170% and 100%, respectively [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )]. CYP3A4 Inducers A published study showed that the co-administration of rifampin, a drug metabolizing enzyme inducer, decreased oxycodone AUC and C max values by 86% and 63%, respectively [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors Oxycodone is metabolized in part to oxymorphone via CYP2D6. While this pathway may be blocked by a variety of drugs such as certain cardiovascular drugs (e.g., quinidine) and antidepressants (e.g., fluoxetine), such blockade has not been shown to be of clinical significance with OXYCONTIN [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )]."

        "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis No animal studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of oxycodone have been conducted. Mutagenesis Oxycodone was genotoxic in the mouse lymphoma assay at concentrations of 50 mcg/mL or greater with metabolic activation and at 400 mcg/mL or greater without metabolic activation. Clastogenicity was observed with oxycodone in the presence of metabolic activation in one chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes at concentrations greater than or equal to 1250 mcg/mL at 24 but not 48 hours of exposure. In a second chromosomal aberration assay with human lymphocytes, no structural clastogenicity was observed either with or without metabolic activation; however, in the absence of metabolic activation, oxycodone increased numerical chromosomal aberrations (polyploidy). Oxycodone was not genotoxic in the following assays: Ames S. typhimurium and E. coli test with and without metabolic activation at concentrations up to 5000 \u00b5g/plate, chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes (in the absence of metabolic activation) at concentrations up to 1500 \u00b5g/mL, and with activation after 48 hours of exposure at concentrations up to 5000 \u00b5g/mL, and in the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in mice (at plasma levels up to 48 \u00b5g/mL). Impairment of Fertility In a study of reproductive performance, rats were administered a once daily gavage dose of the vehicle or oxycodone hydrochloride (0.5, 2, and 8 mg/kg). Male rats were dosed for 28 days before cohabitation with females, during the cohabitation and until necropsy (2-3 weeks post-cohabitation). Females were dosed for 14 days before cohabitation with males, during cohabitation and up to gestation day 6. Oxycodone hydrochloride did not affect reproductive function in male or female rats at any dose tested (\u2264 8 mg/kg/day)."

      "overdosage": [
        "10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation Acute overdosage with OXYCONTIN can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to severe hypoxia in overdose situations. Treatment of Overdose In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen, vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life support techniques. The opioid antagonists, naloxone or nalmefene, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to oxycodone overdose. Such agents should be administered cautiously to persons who are known, or suspected to be physically dependent on OXYCONTIN. In such cases, an abrupt or complete reversal of opioid effects may precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. Because the duration of reversal would be expected to be less than the duration of action of oxycodone in OXYCONTIN, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. OXYCONTIN will continue to release oxycodone and add to the oxycodone load for 24 to 48 hours or longer following ingestion necessitating prolonged monitoring. If the response to opioid antagonists is suboptimal or not sustained, additional antagonist should be administered as directed in the product\u2019s prescribing information. In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the usual dose of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be begun with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist."

        "11 DESCRIPTION Sodium Iodide I 131 (Na I-131) Capsules Therapeutic is supplied for oral administration in opaque white gelatin capsules. The capsules are available in strengths ranging from 28 to 3700 MBq (0.75 to 100 mCi) iodine-131 at the time of calibration. Sodium iodide I-131 capsules are packaged in shielded, plastic vials containing one capsule per vial. Sodium iodide I-131 capsules are prepared by absorbing a solution of carrier-free sodium iodide I-131 that may contain sodium bisulfite into inert filler. The iodine-131 utilized in the preparation of the capsules contains not less than 99% iodine-131 at the time of calibration. The calibration date and the expiration date are stated on the label. 11.1 Physical Characteristics Iodine-131 decays by beta emission and associated gamma emission with a physical half-life of 8.02 days 3 . The principal beta emissions and gamma photons are listed in Table 4. Table 4. Principal Radiation Emission Data Radiation Mean Percent Per Disintegration Energy (keV) Beta-1 2.10 69.4 Avg.

The first half-value thickness of lead (Pb) for iodine-131 is 0.27 cm. A range of values for the relative attenuation of the radiation emitted by this radionuclide that results from interposition of various thicknesses of Pb is shown in Table 5. For example, the use of 4.5 cm of Pb will decrease the external radiation exposure by a factor of about 1,000. Table 5.

The iodide is concentrated in the thyroid via the sodium/iodide symporter, and subsequently oxidized to iodine. The destruction of thyroidal tissue is achieved by the beta emission of sodium iodide I-131."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Radiation-induced thyroiditis: may cause or worsen hyperthyroidism; consider pre-treatment with anti-thyroid medications. ( 5.1 ) Thyroid enlargement, including that due to thyroid stimulating hormone concomitant therapy, may obstruct structures in the neck. Evaluate patients at high risk. ( 5.2 ) Multiple non-thyroid radiation toxicities have been reported following sodium iodide I-131 therapy, including increased risks for neoplasia, hematopoietic suppression, and fetal or reproductive toxicity. Individualize dosage, verify absence of pregnancy, monitor patients for toxicity, and advise patients on contraceptive use. ( 5.3 , 5.5 , 5.6 ) 5.1 Radiation-induced Thyroiditis Sodium iodide I-131 may cause thyroiditis with gland enlargement and release of thyroid hormone, particularly when used to treat hyperthyroidism. The thyroiditis may cause or worsen hyperthyroidism, and may cause thyroid storm. When treating hyperthyroidism, consider pre-treatment with anti-thyroid medication to help deplete the thyroid hormone content within the gland. Discontinue the anti-thyroid medication at least three days before administration of sodium iodide I-131. Consider beta-blocker therapy before administration of sodium iodide I-131 to minimize the risk of hyperthyroidism and thyroid storm. 5.2 Thyroid-stimulating Hormone (TSH) and Thyroid Enlargement Enhanced TSH secretion, e.g., following discontinuation of anti-thyroid medications, or the administration of TSH to enhance sodium iodide I-131 uptake, may cause thyroid enlargement and obstructive complications of the trachea, esophagus, or blood vessels in the neck. Evaluate patients at high risk of obstructive complications before preparative treatments known to cause thyroid enlargement. 5.3 Radiation-induced Toxicities Radiation-induced toxicities, including dose-dependent fatalities, have been reported following sodium iodide I-131 therapy. Post-marketing reports have identified an increased risk for neoplasia, as well as risks for hematopoietic suppression. Salivary and lacrimal gland toxicity is relatively common and may manifest as conjunctivitis, xerophthalmia, epiphora, sialadenitis and xerostomia [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including rash and hives have been reported following administration of sodium iodide I-131. Sodium iodide I-131 capsules may contain sodium bisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions, including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people. During the pre-therapy assessment, question patients about a history of hypersensitivity to sulfite [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . 5.5 Fetal Risk Transplacental passage of sodium iodide I-131 can cause severe and possibly irreversible hypothyroidism in neonates [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Females and Males of Childbearing Potential When planning sodium iodide I-131 therapy for women of childbearing potential, obtain a pregnancy test and verify the absence of a pregnancy before initiating treatment. Advise women and men of childbearing potential to use two effective methods of contraception to avoid pregnancy for at least six months after sodium iodide I-131 administration. Advise patients of the potential need to use two effective methods of contraception to avoid pregnancy for an even longer period of time (e.g., one year) if additional sodium iodide I-131 therapy or radionuclide imaging is anticipated. 5.6 Transient Infertility Transient, dose-related impairment of testicular function has been reported after sodium iodide I-131 therapy. Consider sperm banking for men who are anticipated to receive a high cumulative sodium iodide I-131 dose (e.g., greater than 14 GBq). In females, transient ovarian failure has been observed after sodium iodide I-131 therapy. 5.7 Radiation Exposure Risk to Other Individuals Unwanted radiation exposure can occur from handling and administration of radiopharmaceuticals or from contaminated waste products, including urine and feces. Follow safe administration instructions to minimize unnecessary radiation exposure to patients and health care workers [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Instruct patients on how to reduce unnecessary radiation exposure to others, especially family members following treatment. Review the most recent professional society guidelines and publications that describe the procedures for the safe use of sodium iodide I-131 therapy to minimize radiation toxicity risks to patients, radiation exposure risks to other individuals, and environmental radiation contamination risks.",

Toxic nodular goiter and other situations may require larger doses. ( 2.2 ) Thyroid Carcinoma For thyroid carcinoma, 3700 to 5550 MBq (100 to 150 mCi). ( 2.3 ) For post-operative ablation of normal thyroid tissue: 1850 MBq (50 mCi). ( 2.3 ) Individualize therapy, including dose selection, based upon patient-specific factors detected during the therapeutic planning process. ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Radiation Safety Sodium iodide I-131 capsules emit radiation and must be handled with safety measures to minimize inadvertent radiation exposure to clinical personnel and patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . Radiopharmaceuticals should be used only by or under the direction of phy\u00adsicians who are qualified by training and experience in the safe use and handling of radionuclides and whose experience and training have been approved by the appropriate governmental agency authorized to license the use of radionuclides. Wear waterproof gloves during the entire sodium iodide I-131 capsule handling and administration procedure. Maintain adequate shielding during the radiation-emitting life of the product. Measure the patient dose using a suitable radioactivity calibration system immediately prior to administration. 2.2 Hyperthyroidism For hyperthyroidism, the usual sodium iodide I-131 dose range is 148 to 370 MBq (4 to 10 mCi). Higher doses may be necessary for the treatment of toxic nodular goiter and other special situations. Consider discontinuation of anti-thyroid therapy in a severely hyperthyroid pa\u00adtient three to four days before administration of sodium iodide I-131. Evaluate patients for risk of thyroid enlargement and obstruction of structures in the neck [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.2 )] . 2.3 Thyroid Carcinoma For thyroid carcinoma, the usual sodium iodide I-131 therapeutic dose is 3700 to 5550 MBq (100 to 150 mCi). For ablation of post-operative residual thyroid tissue, the usual dose is 1850 MBq (50 mCi). 2.4 Individualization of Therapy Individualize sodium iodide I-131 therapy, including dose selection, based upon patient-specific factors such as the nature of the underlying condition, co-morbidities, age, estimated thyroid tissue iodine uptake, thyroid size, as well as ability of the patient to comply with the therapeutic regimen and radiation safety procedures. Perform a clinical assessment, including history, physical examination and laboratory testing when preparing patients for sodium iodide I-131 therapy in order to detect conditions which may alter thyroid iodine uptake and increase the risks of the therapy or diminish its effectiveness. For example, intake of iodine in radiographic contrast may diminish thyroid iodine uptake while low serum chloride or nephrosis may increase thyroid iodine uptake.

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing Mothers: to minimize the absorbed radiation dose to breast tissue, discontinue breastfeeding at least four weeks before sodium iodide I-131 therapy. If administered in the postpartum period, the lactating mother should not breast-feed. ( 8.3 ) Pediatric Use: safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. ( 8.4 ) Geriatric Use: enhanced evaluation, dose selection and follow-up procedures may be necessary for geriatric patients due to underlying co-morbidities, including renal dysfunction. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: may increase radiation exposure. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . 8.3 Nursing Mothers Sodium iodide I-131 is excreted into human milk and may reach concentrations equal to or greater than concentrations in maternal plasma. To minimize the absorbed radiation dose to the breast tissue, breastfeeding and breast-pumping should be discontinued for at least four weeks before administration of sodium iodide I-131. Sodium iodide I-131 is contraindicated in pregnancy; if sodium iodide I-131 is administered in the postpartum period, the lactating mother should not breast-feed the infant. Breastfeeding may resume with the birth of another child, if the mother does not receive sodium iodide I-131 during that postpartum period. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Published reports suggest that the thyroid gland of pediatric patients is more sensitive to the effects of sodium iodide I-131; however, it is unknown if the I-131 dose-response relationship is similar to that of adults. When considering the use of sodium iodide I-131 in pediatric patients, the risks, particularly carcinogenic risks, and benefits of sodium iodide I-131 must be carefully weighed against those of other possible treatments. 8.5 Geriatric Use Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function and co-morbid conditions, enhanced evaluation, dose-selection consideration and follow-up may be necessary for elderly patients receiving sodium iodide I-131 therapy, compared to younger patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . When treating hyperthyroidism in geriatric patients at risk of developing cardiac complications, pre-treatment and post-treatment with anti-thyroid drugs and/or beta-blockers may help minimize the risk of excessive post-treatment hyperthyroidism due to radiation-induced thyroiditis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Sodium iodide I-131 is eliminated predominantly through renal clearance. Patients with renal impairment are subject to decreased excretion of sodium iodide I-131 and increased radiation exposure. Evaluate renal function for therapeutic planning [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Sodium iodide I-131 is dialyzable. Hemodialysis can be used to reduce total body radiation exposure.",

Discuss the measures to minimize inadvertent radiation exposure to the patient, members of the patient\u2019s household, the public, and the environment. Advise females and males of reproductive potential of the need to use two effective methods of contraception to avoid pregnancy for at least 6 months after I-131 administration due to fetal risk. Advise patients of the potential need to use two effective methods of contraception to avoid pregnancy for an even longer period of time (e.g., one year) if additional sodium iodide I-131 therapy and further radionuclide imaging is anticipated. Advise patients of the possibility of transient infertility and possible use of sperm banking for males of reproductive potential. Among lactating females, discuss the need to discontinue breastfeeding and pumping at least four weeks before administration of sodium iodide I-131. If sodium iodide I-131 is administered in the postpartum period, advise the lactating mother to not breastfeed her infant. Manufactured by: Mallinckrodt Inc.

      "clinical_pharmacology": [
        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Taken orally, sodium iodide I-131 is rapidly absorbed and distributed within the extracellular fluid of the body. The iodide is concentrated in the thyroid via the sodium/iodide symporter, and subsequently oxidized to iodine. The destruction of thyroidal tissue is achieved by the beta emission of sodium iodide I-131. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The therapeutic effects of sodium iodide I-131 are a result of the ionizing radiation absorbed by the thyroidal tissue. Tissue damage is the result of direct insult to molecules by ionization and excitation and the consequent dissociation of those molecules. About 90% of local irradiation from sodium iodide I-131 is the result of beta radiation and 10% is the result of gamma radiation. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After oral administration, sodium iodide I-131 is absorbed rapidly from the upper gastrointestinal tract (90% in 60 minutes). The pharmacokinetics follow that of unlabelled iodide. After entering the blood stream, the iodide is distributed into the extra thyroidal compartment. From here it is predominantly taken up by the thyroid or excreted renally. In the thyroid, the trapped iodide is oxidized to iodine and organified. The sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) is responsible for the concentration of iodide in the thyroid. This active transport process concentrates iodide 20 to 40 times the plasma concentration under normal circumstances, and this may increase tenfold in the hyperthyroid state. NIS also mediates active iodide transport in other tissues, including salivary glands, nasolacrimal duct, lacrimal sac, gastric mucosa, lactating mammary gland, and the choroid plexus. The non-thyroidal iodide transporting tissues do not have the ability to organify accumulated iodide. Depending on renal and thyroid gland function, urinary excretion is 37 to 75% of the administered dose, fecal excretion is about 10%, and excretion in sweat is almost negligible."

      "overdosage": [
        "10 OVERDOSAGE In case of exposure to a radioactive dose of sodium iodide I-131 exceeding the intended therapeutic dose provide general supportive care, monitor for bone marrow and thyroid suppression and consider administering a thyroid blocking agent such as potassium iodide (KI) or perchlorate promptly within 4 to 6 hours after the exposure. Thyroid blockade may reduce radiation exposure of thyroid tissue but would not prevent radiation injury to the rest of the body. Assess the benefit of administering a blocking agent against the risk of failure of sodium iodide I-131 therapy."

      "drug_abuse_and_dependence": [
        "DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets are a Schedule II controlled substance. Oxycodone is a mu-agonist opioid with an abuse liability similar to morphine. Oxycodone, like morphine and other opioids used in analgesia, can be abused and is subject to criminal diversion. Drug addiction is defined as an abnormal, compulsive use, use for non-medical purposes of a substance despite physical, psychological, occupational or interpersonal difficulties resulting from such use, and continued use despite harm or risk of harm. Drug addiction is a treatable disease, utilizing a multi-disciplinary approach, but relapse is common. Opioid addiction is relatively rare in patients with chronic pain but may be more common in individuals who have a past history of alcohol or substance abuse or dependence. Pseudoaddiction refers to pain relief seeking behavior of patients whose pain is poorly managed. It is considered an iatrogenic effect of ineffective pain management. The health care provider must assess continuously the psychological and clinical condition of a pain patient in order to distinguish addiction from pseudoaddiction and thus, be able to treat the pain adequately. Physical dependence on a prescribed medication does not signify addiction. Physical dependence involves the occurrence of a withdrawal syndrome when there is sudden reduction or cessation in drug use or if an opiate antagonist is administered. Physical dependence can be detected after a few days of opioid therapy. However, clinically significant physical dependence is only seen after several weeks of relatively high dosage therapy. In this case, abrupt discontinuation of the opioid may result in a withdrawal syndrome. If the discontinuation of opioids is therapeutically indicated, gradual tapering of the drug over a 2-week period will prevent withdrawal symptoms. The severity of the withdrawal syndrome depends primarily on the daily dosage of the opioid, the duration of therapy and medical status of the individual. The withdrawal syndrome of oxycodone is similar to that of morphine. This syndrome is characterized by yawning, anxiety, increased heart rate and blood pressure, restlessness, nervousness, muscle aches, tremor, irritability, chills alternating with hot flashes, salivation, anorexia, severe sneezing, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, dilated pupils, diaphoresis, piloerection, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea and insomnia, and pronounced weakness and depression. \u201cDrug-seeking\u201d behavior is very common in addicts and drug abusers. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated \u201closs\u201d of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s). \u201cDoctor Shopping\u201d to obtain additional prescriptions is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated infection. Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Physicians should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction and is characterized by misuse for non-medical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. Oxycodone, like other opioids, has been diverted for non-medical use. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs. Like other opioid medications, oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets are subject to the Federal Controlled Substances Act. After chronic use, oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets should not be discontinued abruptly when it is thought that the patient has become physically dependent on oxycodone."

        "Central Nervous System Oxycodone is a semisynthetic pure opioid agonist whose principal therapeutic action is analgesia. Other pharmacological effects of oxycodone include anxiolysis, euphoria and feelings of relaxation. These effects are mediated by receptors (notably \u03bc and \u03ba) in the central nervous system for endogenous opioid-like compounds such as endorphins and enkephalins. Oxycodone produces respiratory depression through direct activity at respiratory centers in the brain stem and depresses the cough reflex by direct effect on the center of the medulla. Acetaminophen is a non-opiate, non-salicylate analgesic and antipyretic. The site and mechanism for the analgesic effect of acetaminophen has not been determined. The antipyretic effect of acetaminophen is accomplished through the inhibition of endogenous pyrogen action on the hypothalamic heat-regulating centers.",
        "Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Oxycodone reduces motility by increasing smooth muscle tone in the stomach and duodenum. In the small intestine, digestion of food is delayed by decreases in propulsive contractions. Other opioid effects include contraction of biliary tract smooth muscle, spasm of the Sphincter of Oddi, increased ureteral and bladder sphincter tone, and a reduction in uterine tone.",

        "Absorption and Distribution \u2013 The mean absolute oral bioavailability of oxycodone in cancer patients was reported to be about 87%. Oxycodone has been shown to be 45% bound to human plasma proteins in vitro. The volume of distribution after intravenous administration is 211.9 \u00b1 186.6 L. Absorption of acetaminophen is rapid and almost complete from the GI tract after oral administration. With overdosage, absorption is complete in 4 hours. Acetaminophen is relatively uniformly distributed throughout most body fluids. Binding of the drug to plasma proteins is variable; only 20% to 50% may be bound at the concentrations encountered during acute intoxication.",
        "Metabolism and Elimination A high portion of oxycodone is N-dealkylated to noroxycodone during first-pass metabolism. Oxymorphone, is formed by the O-demethylation of oxycodone. The metabolism of oxycodone to oxymorphone is catalyzed by CYP2D6. Free and conjugated noroxycodone, free and conjugated oxycodone, and oxymorphone are excreted in human urine following a single oral dose of oxycodone. Approximately 8% to 14% of the dose is excreted as free oxycodone over 24 hours after administration. Following a single, oral dose of oxycodone, the mean \u00b1 SD elimination half-life is 3.51 \u00b1 1.43 hours. Acetaminophen is metabolized in the liver via cytochrome P450 microsomal enzyme. About 80% to 85% of the acetaminophen in the body is conjugated principally with glucuronic acid and to a lesser extent with sulfuric acid and cysteine. After hepatic conjugation, 90% to 100% of the drug is recovered in the urine within the first day. About 4% of acetaminophen is metabolized via cytochrome P450 oxidase to a toxic metabolite which is further detoxified by conjugation with glutathione, present in a fixed amount. It is believed that the toxic metabolite NAPQI (N acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine, N-acetylimidoquinone) is responsible for liver necrosis. High doses of acetaminophen may deplete the glutathione stores so that inactivation of the toxic metabolite is decreased. At high doses, the capacity of metabolic pathways for conjugation with glucuronic acid and sulfuric acid may be exceeded, resulting in increased metabolism of acetaminophen by alternate pathways.",

Such drugs are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Oxycodone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. Concerns about misuse, addiction, and diversion should not prevent the proper management of pain. Healthcare professionals should contact their State Professional Licensing Board or State Controlled Substances Authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. Administration of oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets should be closely monitored for the following potentially serious adverse reactions and complications:",
        "Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is a hazard with the use of oxycodone, one of the active ingredients in oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets, as with all opioid agonists. Elderly and debilitated patients are at particular risk for respiratory depression as are non-tolerant patients given large initial doses of oxycodone or when oxycodone is given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. Oxycodone should be used with extreme caution in patients with acute asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), cor pulmonale, or preexisting respiratory impairment. In such patients, even usual therapeutic doses of oxycodone may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea. In these patients alternative non-opioid analgesics should be considered, and opioids should be employed only under careful medical supervision at the lowest effective dose. In case of respiratory depression, a reversal agent such as naloxone hydrochloride may be utilized ( see OVERDOSAGE ).",
        "Head Injury and Increased Intracranial Pressure The respiratory depressant effects of opioids include carbon dioxide retention and secondary elevation of cerebrospinal fluid pressure, and may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, other intracranial lesions or a preexisting increase in intracranial pressure. Oxycodone produces effects on pupillary response and consciousness which may obscure neurologic signs of worsening in patients with head injuries.",
        "Hypotensive Effect Oxycodone may cause severe hypotension particularly in individuals whose ability to maintain blood pressure has been compromised by a depleted blood volume, or after concurrent administration with drugs which compromise vasomotor tone such as phenothiazines. Oxycodone, like all opioid analgesics of the morphine-type, should be administered with caution to patients in circulatory shock, since vasodilation produced by the drug may further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Oxycodone may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients.",
        "Hepatotoxicity Precaution should be taken in patients with liver disease. Hepatotoxicity and severe hepatic failure occurred in chronic alcoholics following therapeutic doses.",
        "Acute Abdominal Conditions \u2013 The administration of oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets or other opioids may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions.

Oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions. Oxycodone may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and all opioids may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings.

        "Signs and Symptoms Serious overdose with oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets is characterized by signs and symptoms of opioid and acetaminophen overdose. Oxycodone overdosage can be manifested by respiratory depression (a decrease in respiratory rate and/or tidal volume, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, cyanosis), extreme somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, pupillary constriction (pupils may be dilated in the setting of hypoxia), and sometimes bradycardia and hypotension. In severe overdosage, apnea, circulatory collapse, cardiac arrest and death may occur. In acute acetaminophen overdosage, dose-dependent, potentially fatal hepatic necrosis is the most serious adverse effect. Renal tubular necrosis, hypoglycemic coma and thrombocytopenia may also occur. In adults, hepatic toxicity has rarely been reported with acute overdoses of less than 10 grams and fatalities with less than 15 grams. Plasma acetaminophen levels > 300 mcg/mL at 4 hours post-ingestion were associated with hepatic damage in 90% of patients; minimal hepatic damage is anticipated if plasma levels at 4 hours are < 120 mcg/mL or < 30 mcg/mL at 12 hours after ingestion. Importantly, young children seem to be more resistant than adults to the hepatotoxic effect of an acetaminophen overdose. Despite this, the measures outlined below should be initiated in any adult or child suspected of having ingested an acetaminophen overdose. Early symptoms following a potentially hepatotoxic overdose may include: nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis and general malaise. Clinical and laboratory evidence of hepatic toxicity may not be apparent until 48 to 72 hours post-ingestion.",
        "Treatment Primary attention should be given to the reestablishment of adequate respiratory exchange through provision of a patent airway and the institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. Supportive measures (including oxygen, intravenous fluids, and vasopressors) should be employed in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema accompanying overdose as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias may require cardiac massage or defibrillation. The opioid antagonist naloxone hydrochloride is a specific antidote against respiratory depression which may result from overdosage or unusual sensitivity to opioids including oxycodone. Therefore, an appropriate dose of naloxone hydrochloride should be administered (usual initial adult dose 0.4 mg to 2 mg) preferably by the intravenous route, simultaneously with efforts at respiratory resuscitation. Since the duration of action of oxycodone may exceed that of the antagonist, the patient should be kept under continued surveillance and repeated doses of the antagonist should be administered as needed to maintain adequate respiration. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to oxycodone overdose. In patients who are physically dependent on any opioid agonist including oxycodone, an abrupt or complete reversal of opioid effects may precipitate an acute abstinence syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal syndrome produced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. Please see the prescribing information for the specific opioid antagonist for details of their proper use. Gastric emptying and/or lavage may be useful in removing unabsorbed drug. This procedure is recommended as soon as possible after ingestion, even if the patient has vomited spontaneously. After lavage and/or emesis, administration of activated charcoal, as a slurry, is beneficial, if less than three hours have passed since ingestion. Charcoal adsorption should not be employed prior to lavage and emesis. If an acetaminophen overdose is suspected, the stomach should be promptly emptied by lavage. A serum acetaminophen assay should be obtained as soon as possible, but no sooner than 4 hours following ingestion. Liver function studies should be obtained initially and repeated at 24-hour intervals. The antidote N-acetylcysteine (NAC) should be administered as early as possible, preferably within 16 hours of the overdose ingestion, but in any case within 24 hours. As a guide to treatment of acute ingestion, the acetaminophen level can be plotted against time since ingestion on a nomogram (Rumack-Matthew). The upper toxic line on the nomogram is equivalent to 200 mcg/mL at 4 hours while the lower line is equivalent to 50 mcg/mL at 12 hours. If serum level is above the lower line, an entire course of N-acetylcysteine treatment should be instituted. NAC therapy should be withheld if the acetaminophen level is below the lower line. The toxicity of oxycodone and acetaminophen in combination is unknown.",
        "Cessation of Therapy In patients treated with oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets for more than a few weeks who no longer require therapy, doses should be tapered gradually to prevent signs and symptoms of withdrawal in the physically dependent patient."

      "laboratory_tests": [
        "Laboratory Tests Although oxycodone may cross-react with some drug urine tests, no available studies were found which determined the duration of detectability of oxycodone in urine drug screens. However, based on pharmacokinetic data, the approximate duration of detectability for a single dose of oxycodone is roughly estimated to be one to two days following drug exposure. Urine testing for opiates may be performed to determine illicit drug use and for medical reasons such as evaluation of patients with altered states of consciousness or monitoring efficacy of drug rehabilitation efforts. The preliminary identification of opiates in urine involves the use of an immunoassay screening and thin-layer chromatography (TLC). Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) may be utilized as a third-stage identification step in the medical investigational sequence for opiate testing after immunoassay and TLC. The identities of 6-keto opiates (e.g., oxycodone) can further be differentiated by the analysis of their methoxime-trimethylsilyl (MO-TMS) derivative."

        "Information for Patients/Caregivers The following information should be provided to patients receiving oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets by their physician, nurse, pharmacist, or caregiver: Patients should be aware that oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets contain oxycodone, which is a morphine-like substance. Patients should be instructed to keep oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets in a secure place out of the reach of children. In the case of accidental ingestions, emergency medical care should be sought immediately. When oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets are no longer needed, the unused tablets should be destroyed by flushing down the toilet. Patients should be advised not to adjust the medication dose themselves. Instead, they must consult with their prescribing physician. Patients should be advised that oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets may impair mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks (e.g., driving, operating heavy machinery). Patients should not combine oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets with alcohol, opioid analgesics, tranquilizers, sedatives, or other CNS depressants unless under the recommendation and guidance of a physician. When co-administered with another CNS depressant, oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets can cause dangerous additive central nervous system or respiratory depression, which can result in serious injury or death. The safe use of oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets during pregnancy has not been established; thus, women who are planning to become pregnant or are pregnant should consult with their physician before taking oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets. Nursing mothers should consult with their physicians about whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets because of the potential for serious adverse reactions to nursing infants. Patients who are treated with oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets for more than a few weeks should be advised not to abruptly discontinue the medication. Patients should consult with their physician for a gradual discontinuation dose schedule to taper off the medication. Patients should be advised that oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets are a potential drug of abuse. They should protect it from theft, and it should never be given to anyone other than the individual for whom it was prescribed."

        "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacodynamics Etodolac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that exhibits anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activities in animal models. The mechanism of action of etodolac, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood, but may be related to the prostaglandin synthetase inhibition. Etodolac is a racemic mixture of [-]R- and [+]S-etodolac. As with other NSAIDs, it has been demonstrated in animals that the [+]S-form is biologically active. Both enantiomers are stable and there is no [-]R to [+]S conversion in vivo. Pharmacokinetics Absorption The systemic bioavailability of etodolac from etodolac tablet is 100% as compared to solution and at least 80% as determined from mass balance studies. Etodolac is well absorbed and had a relative bioavailability of 100% when 200 mg capsules were compared with a solution of etodolac. Based on mass balance studies, the systemic availability of etodolac from the tablet formulation is at least 80%. Etodolac does not undergo significant first-pass metabolism following oral administration. Mean (\u00b1 1 SD) peak plasma concentrations (C max ) range from approximately 14 \u00b1 4 to 37 \u00b1 9 mcg/mL after 200 to 600 mg single doses and are reached in 80 \u00b1 30 minutes (see Table 1 for summary of pharmacokinetic parameters). The dose-proportionality based on the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) is linear following doses up to 600 mg every 12 hours. Peak concentrations are dose proportional for both total and free etodolac following doses up to 400 mg every 12 hours, but following a 600 mg dose, the peak is about 20% higher than predicted on the basis of lower doses. The extent of absorption of etodolac is not affected when etodolac tablets are administered after a meal. Food intake, however, reduces the peak concentration reached by approximately one-half and increases the time to peak concentration by 1.4 to 3.8 hours. Table 1.

It is not known whether etodolac is excreted in human milk; however, based on its physical-chemical properties, excretion into breast milk is expected. Data from in vitro studies, using peak serum concentrations at reported therapeutic doses in humans, show that the etodolac free fraction is not significantly altered by acetaminophen, ibuprofen, indomethacin, naproxen, piroxicam, chlorpropamide, glipizide, glyburide, phenytoin, and probenecid. Metabolism Etodolac is extensively metabolized in the liver. The role, if any, of a specific cytochrome P450 system in the metabolism of etodolac is unknown. Several etodolac metabolites have been identified in human plasma and urine. Other metabolites remain to be identified. The metabolites include 6-, 7-, and 8- hydroxylated-etodolac and etodolac glucuronide. After a single dose of 14 C-etodolac, hydroxylated metabolites accounted for less than 10% of total drug in serum. On chronic dosing, hydroxylated-etodolac metabolite does not accumulate in the plasma of patients with normal renal function. The extent of accumulation of hydroxylated-etodolac metabolites in patients with renal dysfunction has not been studied. The hydroxylated-etodolac metabolites undergo further glucuronidation followed by renal excretion and partial elimination in the feces. Excretion The mean oral clearance of etodolac following oral dosing is 49 (\u00b1 16) mL/h/kg. Approximately 1% of an etodolac dose is excreted unchanged in the urine with 72% of the dose excreted into urine as parent drug plus metabolite: -etodolac, unchanged 1% -etodolac glucuronide 13% -hydroxylated metabolites (6-, 7-, and 8-OH) 5% -hydroxylated metabolite glucuronides 20% -unidentified metabolites 33% Although renal elimination is a significant pathway of excretion for etodolac metabolites, no dosing adjustment in patients with mild to moderate renal dysfunction is generally necessary. The terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) of etodolac is 6.4 hours (22% CV). In patients with severe renal dysfunction or undergoing hemodialysis, dosing adjustment is not generally necessary. Fecal excretion accounted for 16% of the dose. Special Populations Geriatric In etodolac clinical studies, no overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. In pharmacokinetic studies, age was shown not to have any effect on etodolac half-life or protein binding, and there was no change in expected drug accumulation. Therefore no dosage adjustment is generally necessary in the elderly on the basis of pharmacokinetics (see PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use ). Etodolac is eliminated primarily by the kidney. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function (see WARNINGS, Renal Effects ). Pediatric Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been established. Race Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified. Clinical studies included patients of many races, all of whom responded in a similar fashion. Hepatic Insufficiency Etodolac is predominantly metabolized by the liver. In patients with compensated hepatic cirrhosis, the disposition of total and free etodolac is not altered. Patients with acute and chronic hepatic diseases do not generally require reduced doses of etodolac compared to patients with normal hepatic function. However, etodolac clearance is dependent on liver function and could be reduced in patients with severe hepatic failure. Etodolac plasma protein binding did not change in patients with compensated hepatic cirrhosis given etodolac. Renal Insufficiency Etodolac pharmacokinetics have been investigated in subjects with renal insufficiency. Etodolac renal clearance was unchanged in the presence of mild-to-moderate renal failure (creatinine clearance 37 to 88 mL/min). Furthermore, there were no significant differences in the disposition of total and free etodolac in these patients. However, etodolac should be used with caution in such patients because, as with other NSAIDs, it may further decrease renal function in some patients. In patients undergoing hemodialysis, there was a 50% greater apparent clearance of total etodolac, due to a 50% greater unbound fraction. Free etodolac clearance was not altered, indicating the importance of protein binding in etodolac's disposition. Etodolac is not significantly removed from the blood in patients undergoing hemodialysis."

        "Pharmacodynamics Etodolac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that exhibits anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activities in animal models. The mechanism of action of etodolac, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood, but may be related to the prostaglandin synthetase inhibition. Etodolac is a racemic mixture of [-]R- and [+]S-etodolac. As with other NSAIDs, it has been demonstrated in animals that the [+]S-form is biologically active. Both enantiomers are stable and there is no [-]R to [+]S conversion in vivo."

      "pharmacokinetics": [
        "Pharmacokinetics Absorption The systemic bioavailability of etodolac from etodolac tablet is 100% as compared to solution and at least 80% as determined from mass balance studies. Etodolac is well absorbed and had a relative bioavailability of 100% when 200 mg capsules were compared with a solution of etodolac. Based on mass balance studies, the systemic availability of etodolac from the tablet formulation is at least 80%. Etodolac does not undergo significant first-pass metabolism following oral administration. Mean (\u00b1 1 SD) peak plasma concentrations (C max ) range from approximately 14 \u00b1 4 to 37 \u00b1 9 mcg/mL after 200 to 600 mg single doses and are reached in 80 \u00b1 30 minutes (see Table 1 for summary of pharmacokinetic parameters). The dose-proportionality based on the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) is linear following doses up to 600 mg every 12 hours. Peak concentrations are dose proportional for both total and free etodolac following doses up to 400 mg every 12 hours, but following a 600 mg dose, the peak is about 20% higher than predicted on the basis of lower doses. The extent of absorption of etodolac is not affected when etodolac tablets are administered after a meal. Food intake, however, reduces the peak concentration reached by approximately one-half and increases the time to peak concentration by 1.4 to 3.8 hours. Table 1.

        "CLINICAL TRIALS Analgesia Controlled clinical trials in analgesia were single-dose, randomized, double-blind, parallel studies in three pain models, including dental extractions. The analgesic effective dose for etodolac established in these acute pain models was 200 to 400 mg. The onset of analgesia occurred approximately 30 minutes after oral administration. Etodolac 200 mg provided efficacy comparable to that obtained with aspirin (650 mg). Etodolac 400 mg provided efficacy comparable to that obtained with acetaminophen with codeine (600 mg + 60 mg). The peak analgesic effect was between 1 to 2 hours. Duration of relief averaged 4 to 5 hours for 200 mg of etodolac and 5 to 6 hours for 400 mg of etodolac as measured by when approximately half of the patients required remedication. Osteoarthritis The use of etodolac in managing the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis of the hip or knee was assessed in double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trials in 341 patients. In patients with osteoarthritis of the knee, etodolac, in doses of 600 to 1000 mg/day, was better than placebo in two studies. The clinical trials in osteoarthritis used b.i.d. dosage regimens. Rheumatoid Arthritis In a 3-month study with 426 patients, etodolac 300 mg b.i.d. was effective in management of rheumatoid arthritis and comparable in efficacy to piroxicam 20 mg/day. In a long-term study with 1,446 patients in which 60% of patients completed 6 months of therapy and 20% completed 3 years of therapy, etodolac in a dose of 500 mg b.i.d. provided efficacy comparable to that obtained with ibuprofen 600 mg q.i.d. In clinical trials of rheumatoid arthritis patients, etodolac has been used in combination with gold, d-penicillamine, chloroquine, corticosteroids, and methotrexate."

        "WARNINGS CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as etodolac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events (see WARNINGS ). Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Post-MI Patients Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up. Avoid the use of etodolac in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If etodolac is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia. Hypertension NSAIDs, including etodolac, can lead to onset of new hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking thiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. NSAIDs, including etodolac, should be used with caution in patients with hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) should be monitored closely during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy. Heart Failure and Edema The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death. Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of etodolac may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions [e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)] (see DRUG INTERACTIONS ). Avoid the use of etodolac in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If etodolac is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure. Gastrointestinal Effects - Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation NSAIDs, including etodolac, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2 to 4% of patients treated for one year. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk. Physicians should inform patients about the signs and/or symptoms of serious GI toxicity and what steps to take if they occur. NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease, and/or gastrointestinal bleeding , and who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients, and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered. Renal Effects Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greater risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state. Renal pelvic transitional epithelial hyperplasia, a spontaneous change occurring with variable frequency, was observed with increased frequency in treated male rats in a 2-year chronic study. Caution is recommended in patients with pre-existing kidney disease. Advanced Renal Disease No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of etodolac, in patients with advanced renal disease. Therefore, treatment with etodolac is not recommended in these patients with advanced renal disease. If etodolac therapy must be initiated, close monitoring of the patient's renal function is advisable. Anaphylactoid Reactions As with other NSAIDs, anaphylactoid reactions may occur in patients without prior exposure to etodolac. Etodolac should not be given to patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs in asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. Fatal reactions have been reported in such patients (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS, General, Pre-existing Asthma ). Emergency help should be sought in cases where an anaphylactoid reaction occurs. Serious Skin Reactions NSAIDs, including etodolac, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. NSAIDs can also cause fixed drug eruption (FDE). FDE may present as a more severe variant known as generalized bullous fixed drug eruption (GBFDE), which can be life-threatening. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of etodolac tablets at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Etodolac tablets is contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported in patients taking NSAIDs such as etodolac. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling. Other clinical manifestations may include hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis. Sometimes symptoms of DRESS may resemble an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its presentation, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, discontinue etodolac and evaluate the patient immediately. Fetal Toxicity Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Avoid use of NSAIDs, including etodolac, in pregnant women at about 30 weeks gestation and later. NSAIDs including etodolac, increase the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at approximately this gestational age. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Use of NSAIDs, including etodolac, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. Oligohydramnios is often, but not always, reversible with treatment discontinuation. Complications of prolonged oligohydramnios may, for example, include limb contractures and delayed lung maturation. In some postmarketing cases of impaired neonatal renal function, invasive procedures such as exchange transfusion or dialysis were required. If NSAID treatment is necessary between about 20 weeks and 30 weeks gestation, limit etodolac use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. Consider ultrasound monitoring of amniotic fluid if etodolac treatment extends beyond 48 hours. Discontinue etodolac if oligohydramnios occurs and follow up according to clinical practice [see PRECAUTIONS; Pregnancy ]."

      "precautions": [
        "PRECAUTIONS General Etodolac cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered solely if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids. The pharmacological activity of etodolac in reducing fever and inflammation may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting complications of presumed non-infectious, painful conditions. Hepatic Effects Borderline elevations of one or more liver tests may occur in up to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs including etodolac. These laboratory abnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged, or may be transient with continuing therapy. Notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately three or more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs. In addition, rare cases of severe hepatic reactions, including jaundice and fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis and hepatic failure, some of them with fatal outcomes, have been reported. A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be evaluated for evidence of the development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with etodolac. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), etodolac should be discontinued. Hematological Effects Anemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving NSAIDs including etodolac tablets. This may be due to fluid retention, occult or gross GI blood loss, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs, including etodolac tablets should have their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia. NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect on platelet function is quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible. Patients receiving etodolac tablets, who may be adversely affected by alterations in platelet function, such as those with coagulation disorders or patients receiving anticoagulants, should be carefully monitored. Pre-existing Asthma Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthmas has been associated with severe bronchospasm which can be fatal. Since cross reactivity, including bronchospasm, between aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, etodolac should not be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be used with caution in all patients with pre-existing asthma. Information for Patients Patients should be informed of the following information before initiating therapy with an NSAID and periodically during the course of on-going therapy. Patients should also be encouraged to read the NSAID Medication Guide that accompanies each prescription dispensed. 1. Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of cardiovascular thrombotic events, including chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, or slurring of speech, and to report any of these symptoms to their health care provider immediately (see WARNINGS ) . 2. Etodolac, like other NSAIDs, can cause GI discomfort and, rarely, serious GI side effects, such as ulcers and bleeding, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up (see WARNINGS, Gastrointestinal Effects - Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation ). 3. Serious Skin Reactions, including DRESS Advise patients to stop taking etodolac immediately if they develop any type of rash or fever and to contact their healthcare provider as soon as possible [see Warnings ]. 4. Heart Failure And Edema Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of congestive heart failure including shortness of breath, unexplained weight gain, or edema and to contact their healthcare provider if such symptoms occur (see WARNINGS ) . 5. Patients should be informed of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and \"flu-like\" symptoms). If these occur, patients should be instructed to stop therapy and seek immediate medical therapy. 6. Patients should be informed of the signs of an anaphylactoid reaction (e.g. difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat). If these occur, patients should be instructed to seek immediate emergency help (see WARNINGS ). 7. Fetal Toxicity Inform pregnant women to avoid use of etodolac and other NSAIDs starting at 30 weeks gestation because of the risk of the premature closing of the fetal ductus arteriosus. If treatment with etodolac is needed for a pregnant woman between about 20 to 30 weeks gestation, advise her that she may need to be monitored for oligohydramnios, if treatment continues for longer than 48 hours [see WARNINGS; Fetal Toxicity, PRECAUTIONS; Pregnancy ] . Laboratory Tests Because serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI bleeding. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs should have their CBC and a chemistry profile checked periodically for signs or symptoms of anemia. Appropriate measures should be taken in case such signs of anemia occur. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver or renal disease develop, systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.) or if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, etodolac should be discontinued. Drug Interactions ACE-inhibitors Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE-inhibitors. This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors (see WARNINGS ). Antacids The concomitant administration of antacids has no apparent effect on the extent of absorption of etodolac. However, antacids can decrease the peak concentration reached by 15% to 20% but have no detectable effect on the time-to-peak. Aspirin When etodolac is administered with aspirin, its protein binding is reduced, although the clearance of free etodolac is not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known; however, as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of etodolac and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects. Cyclosporine, Digoxin, Methotrexate Etodolac, like other NSAIDs, through effects on renal prostaglandins, may cause changes in the elimination of these drugs leading to elevated serum levels of cyclosporine, digoxin, methotrexate, and increased toxicity. Nephrotoxicity associated with cyclosporine may also be enhanced. Patients receiving these drugs who are given etodolac, or any other NSAID, and particularly those patients with altered renal function, should be observed for the development of the specific toxicities of these drugs. NSAIDs, such as etodolac, should not be administered prior to or concomitantly with high doses of methotrexate. NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. In general, caution should be used when NSAIDs are administered concomitantly with methotrexate. Diuretics Etodolac has no apparent pharmacokinetic interaction when administered with furosemide or hydrochlorothiazide. Nevertheless, clinical studies, as well as postmarketing observations have shown that etodolac can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients with possible loss of blood pressure control. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal insufficiency or failure (see WARNINGS, Renal Effects ), as well as to assure diuretic efficacy. Glyburide Etodolac has no apparent pharmacokinetic interaction when administered with glyburide. Lithium NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity. Careful monitoring of lithium levels is advised in the event NSAID dosage adjustments are required. Phenylbutazone Phenylbutazone causes increase (by about 80%) in the free fraction of etodolac. Although in vivo studies have not been done to see if etodolac clearance is changed by co-administration of phenylbutazone, it is not recommended that they be co-administered. Phenytoin Etodolac has no apparent pharmacokinetic interaction when administered with phenytoin. Warfarin The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than that of users of either drug alone. Short-term pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that concomitant administration of warfarin and etodolac results in reduced protein binding of warfarin, but there was no change in the clearance of free warfarin. There was no significant difference in the pharmacodynamic effect of warfarin administered alone and warfarin administered with etodolac as measured by prothrombin time. Thus, concomitant therapy with warfarin and etodolac should not require dosage adjustment of either drug. However, caution should be exercised because there have been a few spontaneous reports of prolonged prothrombin times, with or without bleeding, in etodolac-treated patients receiving concomitant warfarin therapy. Close monitoring of such patients is therefore recommended. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions The urine of patients who take etodolac can give a false-positive reaction for urinary bilirubin (urobilin) due to the presence of phenolic metabolites of etodolac. Diagnostic dip-stick methodology, used to detect ketone bodies in urine, has resulted in false-positive findings in some patients treated with etodolac. Generally, this phenomenon has not been associated with other clinically significant events. No dose relationship has been observed. Etodolac treatment is associated with a small decrease in serum uric acid levels. In clinical trials, mean decreases of 1 to 2 mg/dL were observed in arthritic patients receiving etodolac (600 to 1000 mg/day) after 4 weeks of therapy. These levels then remained stable for up to 1 year of therapy. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility No carcinogenic effect of etodolac was observed in mice or rats receiving oral doses of 15 mg/kg/day (45 to 89 mg/m 2 , respectively) or less for periods of 2 years or 18 months, respectively. Etodolac was not mutagenic in in vitro tests performed with S. typhimurium and mouse lymphoma cells as well as in an in vivo mouse micronucleus test. However, data from the in vitro human peripheral lymphocyte test showed an increase in the number of gaps (3 to 5.3% unstained regions in the chromatid without dislocation) among the etodolac-treated cultures (50 to 200 mcg/mL) compared to negative controls (2%); no other difference was noted between the controls and drug-treated groups. Etodolac showed no impairment of fertility in male and female rats up to oral doses of 16 mg/kg (94 mg/m 2 ). However, reduced implantation of fertilized eggs occurred in the 8 mg/kg group. Pregnancy Risk Summary Use of NSAIDs, including etodolac, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. Because of these risks, limit dose and duration of etodolac use between about 20 and 30 weeks of gestation, and avoid etodolac use at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy [see WARNINGS; Fetal Toxicity ]. Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus Use of NSAIDs, including etodolac, at about 30 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy increases the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment Use of NSAIDs at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. Data from observational studies regarding other potential embryofetal risks of NSAID use in women in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. In animal reproduction studies, isolated occurrences of alterations in limb development were found and included polydactyly, oligodactyly, syndactyly, and unossified phalanges in rats and oligodactyly and synostosis of metatarsals in rabbits. These were observed at dose levels (2 to 14 mg/kg/day) close to human clinical doses. However, the frequency and the dosage group distribution of these findings in initial or repeated studies did not establish a clear drug or dose-response relationship. Animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response. Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as etodolac, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss. Prostaglandins also have been shown to have an important role in fetal kidney development. In published animal studies, prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors have been reported to impair kidney development when administered at clinically relevant doses. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Avoid use of NSAIDs in women at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy, because NSAIDs, including etodolac, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus (see WARNINGS; Fetal Toxicity ). Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment If an NSAID is necessary at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy, limit the use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. If etodolac treatment extends beyond 48 hours, consider monitoring with ultrasound for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, discontinue etodolac and follow up according to clinical practice (see WARNINGS; Fetal Toxicity ) . Data Human Data There are no adequate, well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Etodolac tablets should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Published literature reports that the use of NSAIDs at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis. Methodological limitations of these postmarketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain. Labor and Delivery In rat studies with NSAIDs, as with other drugs known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, an increased incidence of dystocia, delayed parturition, and decreased pup survival occurred. The effects of etodolac on labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown. Nursing Mothers Trace amounts of some NSAIDs have been reported in human milk. It is not known whether etodolac is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from etodolac, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 18 have not been established. Geriatric Use As with any NSAID, caution should be exercised in treating the elderly (65 years and older) and when increasing the dose (see WARNINGS ). In etodolac clinical studies, no overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. In pharmacokinetic studies, age was shown not to have any effect on etodolac half-life or protein binding, and there was no change in expected drug accumulation. Therefore, no dosage adjustment is generally necessary in the elderly on the basis of pharmacokinetics (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Special Populations ). Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the antiprostaglandin effects of NSAIDs (on the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys) than younger patients (see WARNINGS ). In particular, elderly or debilitated patients who receive NSAID therapy seem to tolerate gastrointestinal ulceration or bleeding less well than other individuals, and most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in this population. Etodolac is eliminated primarily by the kidney. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function (see WARNINGS, Renal Effects )."

Patients receiving these drugs who are given etodolac, or any other NSAID, and particularly those patients with altered renal function, should be observed for the development of the specific toxicities of these drugs. NSAIDs, such as etodolac, should not be administered prior to or concomitantly with high doses of methotrexate. NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. In general, caution should be used when NSAIDs are administered concomitantly with methotrexate. Diuretics Etodolac has no apparent pharmacokinetic interaction when administered with furosemide or hydrochlorothiazide. Nevertheless, clinical studies, as well as postmarketing observations have shown that etodolac can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients with possible loss of blood pressure control. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal insufficiency or failure (see WARNINGS, Renal Effects ), as well as to assure diuretic efficacy. Glyburide Etodolac has no apparent pharmacokinetic interaction when administered with glyburide. Lithium NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity. Careful monitoring of lithium levels is advised in the event NSAID dosage adjustments are required. Phenylbutazone Phenylbutazone causes increase (by about 80%) in the free fraction of etodolac. Although in vivo studies have not been done to see if etodolac clearance is changed by co-administration of phenylbutazone, it is not recommended that they be co-administered. Phenytoin Etodolac has no apparent pharmacokinetic interaction when administered with phenytoin. Warfarin The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than that of users of either drug alone. Short-term pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that concomitant administration of warfarin and etodolac results in reduced protein binding of warfarin, but there was no change in the clearance of free warfarin. There was no significant difference in the pharmacodynamic effect of warfarin administered alone and warfarin administered with etodolac as measured by prothrombin time. Thus, concomitant therapy with warfarin and etodolac should not require dosage adjustment of either drug. However, caution should be exercised because there have been a few spontaneous reports of prolonged prothrombin times, with or without bleeding, in etodolac-treated patients receiving concomitant warfarin therapy. Close monitoring of such patients is therefore recommended. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions The urine of patients who take etodolac can give a false-positive reaction for urinary bilirubin (urobilin) due to the presence of phenolic metabolites of etodolac. Diagnostic dip-stick methodology, used to detect ketone bodies in urine, has resulted in false-positive findings in some patients treated with etodolac. Generally, this phenomenon has not been associated with other clinically significant events. No dose relationship has been observed. Etodolac treatment is associated with a small decrease in serum uric acid levels. In clinical trials, mean decreases of 1 to 2 mg/dL were observed in arthritic patients receiving etodolac (600 to 1000 mg/day) after 4 weeks of therapy. These levels then remained stable for up to 1 year of therapy."

        "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility No carcinogenic effect of etodolac was observed in mice or rats receiving oral doses of 15 mg/kg/day (45 to 89 mg/m 2 , respectively) or less for periods of 2 years or 18 months, respectively. Etodolac was not mutagenic in in vitro tests performed with S. typhimurium and mouse lymphoma cells as well as in an in vivo mouse micronucleus test. However, data from the in vitro human peripheral lymphocyte test showed an increase in the number of gaps (3 to 5.3% unstained regions in the chromatid without dislocation) among the etodolac-treated cultures (50 to 200 mcg/mL) compared to negative controls (2%); no other difference was noted between the controls and drug-treated groups. Etodolac showed no impairment of fertility in male and female rats up to oral doses of 16 mg/kg (94 mg/m 2 ). However, reduced implantation of fertilized eggs occurred in the 8 mg/kg group."

      "pregnancy": [
        "Pregnancy Risk Summary Use of NSAIDs, including etodolac, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. Because of these risks, limit dose and duration of etodolac use between about 20 and 30 weeks of gestation, and avoid etodolac use at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy [see WARNINGS; Fetal Toxicity ]. Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus Use of NSAIDs, including etodolac, at about 30 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy increases the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment Use of NSAIDs at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. Data from observational studies regarding other potential embryofetal risks of NSAID use in women in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. In animal reproduction studies, isolated occurrences of alterations in limb development were found and included polydactyly, oligodactyly, syndactyly, and unossified phalanges in rats and oligodactyly and synostosis of metatarsals in rabbits. These were observed at dose levels (2 to 14 mg/kg/day) close to human clinical doses. However, the frequency and the dosage group distribution of these findings in initial or repeated studies did not establish a clear drug or dose-response relationship. Animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response. Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as etodolac, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss. Prostaglandins also have been shown to have an important role in fetal kidney development. In published animal studies, prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors have been reported to impair kidney development when administered at clinically relevant doses. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Avoid use of NSAIDs in women at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy, because NSAIDs, including etodolac, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus (see WARNINGS; Fetal Toxicity ). Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment If an NSAID is necessary at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy, limit the use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. If etodolac treatment extends beyond 48 hours, consider monitoring with ultrasound for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, discontinue etodolac and follow up according to clinical practice (see WARNINGS; Fetal Toxicity ) . Data Human Data There are no adequate, well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Etodolac tablets should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Published literature reports that the use of NSAIDs at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis. Methodological limitations of these postmarketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain. Labor and Delivery In rat studies with NSAIDs, as with other drugs known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, an increased incidence of dystocia, delayed parturition, and decreased pup survival occurred. The effects of etodolac on labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown."

Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur and coma has occurred following massive ibuprofen or mefenamic-acid overdose. Hypertension, acute renal failure, and respiratory depression may occur but are rare. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with therapeutic ingestion of NSAIDs, and may occur following overdose. Patients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care following an NSAID overdose. There are no specific antidotes. Emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 g in adults, 1 to 2 g/kg in children) and/or osmotic cathartic may be indicated in patients seen within 4 hours of ingestion with symptoms or following a large overdose (5 to 10 times the usual dose). Forced diuresis, alkalinization of the urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion would probably not be useful due to etodolac's high protein binding."

      "dosage_and_administration": [
        "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of etodolac tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use etodolac tablets. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS ). After observing the response to initial therapy with etodolac tablets, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs. Dosage adjustment of etodolac tablets is generally not required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Etodolac should be used with caution in such patients, because, as with other NSAIDs, it may further decrease renal function in some patients with impaired renal function (see WARNINGS, Renal Effects ). Analgesia The recommended total daily dose of etodolac for acute pain is up to 1000 mg, given as 200 to 400 mg every 6 to 8 hours. Doses of etodolac greater than 1000 mg/day have not been adequately evaluated in well-controlled trials. Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis The recommended starting dose of etodolac for the management of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis is: 300 mg b.i.d., t.i.d., or 400 mg b.i.d., or 500 mg b.i.d. A lower dose of 600 mg/day may suffice for long-term administration. Physicians should be aware that doses above 1000 mg/day have not been adequately evaluated in well-controlled clinical trials. In chronic conditions, a therapeutic response to therapy with etodolac is sometimes seen within one week of therapy, but most often is observed by two weeks. After a satisfactory response has been achieved, the patient's dose should be reviewed and adjusted as required."

        "Medication Guide for Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) What is the most important information I should know about medicines called Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)? NSAIDs can cause serious side effects, including: Increased risk of a heart attack or stroke that can lead to death. This risk may happen early in treatment and may increase: with increasing doses of NSAIDs with longer use of NSAIDs Do not take NSAIDs right before or after a heart surgery called a \"coronary artery bypass graft (CABG).\" Avoid taking NSAIDs after a recent heart attack, unless your healthcare provider tells you to. You may have an increased risk of another heart attack if you take NSAIDs after a recent heart attack. Increased risk of bleeding, ulcers, and tears (perforation) of the esophagus (tube leading from the mouth to the stomach), stomach and intestines: anytime during use without warning symptoms that may cause death The risk of getting an ulcer or bleeding increases with: past history of stomach ulcers, or stomach or intestinal bleeding with use of NSAIDs taking medicines called \"corticosteroids\", \"anticoagulants\", \"SSRIs\", or \"SNRIs\" o increasing doses of NSAIDs o longer use of NSAIDs o smoking o drinking alcohol o older age o poor health o advanced liver disease o bleeding problems NSAIDs should only be used: exactly as prescribed at the lowest dose possible for your treatment for the shortest time needed What are NSAIDs? NSAIDs are used to treat pain and redness, swelling, and heat (inflammation) from medical conditions such as different types of arthritis, menstrual cramps, and other types of short-term pain. Who should not take NSAIDs? Do not take NSAIDs: if you have had an asthma attack, hives, or other allergic reaction with aspirin or any other NSAIDs. right before or after heart bypass surgery. Before taking NSAIDs, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: have liver or kidney problems have high blood pressure have asthma are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Taking NSAIDs at about 20 weeks of pregnancy or later may harm your unborn baby. If you need to take NSAIDs for more than 2 days when you are between 20 and 30 weeks of pregnancy, your healthcare provider may need to monitor the amount of fluid in your womb around your baby. You should not take NSAIDs after about 30 weeks of pregnancy. are breastfeeding or plan to breast feed. Tell your healthcare provider about all of the medicines you take, including prescription or over-the-counter medicines, vitamins or herbal supplements. NSAIDs and some other medicines can interact with each other and cause serious side effects. Do not start taking any new medicine without talking to your healthcare provider first. What are the possible side effects of NSAIDs? NSAIDs can cause serious side effects, including: See \"What is the most important information I should know about medicines called Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)? new or worse high blood pressure heart failure liver problems including liver failure kidney problems including kidney failure low red blood cells (anemia) life-threatening skin reactions life-threatening allergic reactions Other side effects of NSAIDs include: stomach pain, constipation, diarrhea, gas, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness.

      "precautions": [
        "Precautions General As with all broad\u2010spectrum antibiotics, Cefizox (ceftizoxime for injection, USP) should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis. Although Cefizox has not been shown to produce an alteration in renal function, renal status should be evaluated, especially in seriously ill patients receiving maximum dose therapy. As with any antibiotic, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Careful observation is essential; appropriate measures should be taken if superinfection occurs. Cephalosporins may be associated with a fall in prothrombin activity. Those at risk include patients with renal or hepatic impairment, or poor nutritional state, as well as patients receiving a protracted course of antimicrobial therapy, and patients previously stabilized on anticoagulant therapy. Prothrombin time should be monitored in patients at risk and exogenous vitamin K administered as indicated. Prescribing Cefizox in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Drug Interactions Although the occurrence has not been reported with Cefizox, nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of other cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long\u2010term studies in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of ceftizoxime have not been conducted. In an in vitro bacterial cell assay (i.e., Ames test), there was no evidence of mutagenicity at ceftizoxime concentrations of 0.001\u20100.5 mcg/plate. Ceftizoxime did not produce increases in micronuclei in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test when given to animals at doses up to 7500 mg/kg, approximately six times greater than the maximum human daily dose on a mg/M 2 basis. Ceftizoxime had no effect on fertility when administered subcutaneously to rats at daily doses of up to 1000 mg/kg/day, approximately two times the maximum human daily dose on a mg/M 2 basis. Ceftizoxime produced no histological changes in the sexual organs of male and female dogs when given intravenously for thirteen weeks at a dose of 1000 mg/kg/day, approximately five times greater than the maximum human daily dose on a mg/M 2 basis. Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies performed in rats and rabbits have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Cefizox. There are, however, no adequate and well\u2010controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human effects, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Labor and Delivery Safety of Cefizox use during labor and delivery has not been established. Nursing Mothers Cefizox is excreted in human milk in low concentrations. Caution should be exercised when Cefizox is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients from birth to six months of age have not been established. In pediatric patients six months of age and older, treatment with Cefizox has been associated with transient elevated levels of eosinophils, AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), and CPK (creatine phosphokinase). The CPK elevation may be related to IM administration. The potential for the toxic effect in pediatric patients from chemicals that may leach from the single\u2010dose IV preparation in plastic has not been determined. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of ceftizoxime did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Cefizox should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Cefizox is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Cefizox or other antibacterial drugs in the future."

        "General As with all broad\u2010spectrum antibiotics, Cefizox (ceftizoxime for injection, USP) should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis. Although Cefizox has not been shown to produce an alteration in renal function, renal status should be evaluated, especially in seriously ill patients receiving maximum dose therapy. As with any antibiotic, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Careful observation is essential; appropriate measures should be taken if superinfection occurs. Cephalosporins may be associated with a fall in prothrombin activity. Those at risk include patients with renal or hepatic impairment, or poor nutritional state, as well as patients receiving a protracted course of antimicrobial therapy, and patients previously stabilized on anticoagulant therapy. Prothrombin time should be monitored in patients at risk and exogenous vitamin K administered as indicated. Prescribing Cefizox in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria."

        "Indications and Usage Cefizox (ceftizoxime for injection, USP) is indicated in the treatment of infections due to susceptible strains of the microorganisms listed below. Lower Respiratory Tract Infections caused by Klebsiella spp.; Proteus mirabilis ; Escherichia coli; Haemophilus influenzae including ampicillin\u2010resistant strains; Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase\u00ad and nonpenicillinase\u2010producing); Serratia spp.; Enterobacter spp.; Bacteroides spp.; and Streptococcus spp. including S. pneumoniae , but excluding enterococci. Urinary Tract Infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase\u2010 and nonpenicillinase\u2010producing); Escherichia coli ; Pseudomonas spp. including P. aeruginosa ; Proteus mirabilis ; P. vulgaris ; Providencia rettgeri (formerly Proteus rettgeri ) and Morganella morganii (formerly Proteus morganii ); Klebsiella spp.; Serratia spp. including S. marcescens ; and Enterobacter spp. Gonorrhea including uncomplicated cervical and urethral gonorrhea caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Pelvic Inflammatory Disease caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli or Streptococcus agalactiae . NOTE: Ceftizoxime, like other cephalosporins, has no activity against Chlamydia trachomatis . Therefore, when cephalosporins are used in the treatment of patients with pelvic inflammatory disease and C. trachomatis is one of the suspected pathogens, appropriate anti\u00adchlamydial coverage should be added. Intra\u2010Abdominal Infections caused by Escherichia coli; Staphylococcus epidermidis; Streptococcus spp. (excluding enterococci); Enterobacter spp.; Klebsiella spp.; Bacteroides spp. including B. fragilis ; and anaerobic cocci, including Peptococcus spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. Septicemia caused by Streptococcus spp. including S. pneumoniae (but excluding enterococci); Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase\u2010 and nonpenicillinase\u2010producing); Escherichia coli; Bacteroides spp. including B. fragilis ; Klebsiella spp.; and Serratia spp. Skin and Skin Structure Infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase\u2010 and nonpenicillinase\u2010producing); Staphylococcus epidermidis ; Escherichia coli; Klebsiella spp.; Streptococcus spp. including Streptococcus pyogenes (but excluding enterococci); Proteus mirabilis ; Serratia spp.; Enterobacter spp.; Bacteroides spp. including B. fragilis ; and anaerobic cocci, including Peptococcus spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. Bone and Joint Infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase\u2010 and nonpenicillinase\u2010producing); Streptococcus spp. (excluding enterococci); Proteus mirabilis ; Bacteroides spp.; and anaerobic cocci, including Peptococcus spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. Meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae . Cefizox has also been used successfully in the treatment of a limited number of pediatric and adult cases of meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae . Cefizox has been effective in the treatment of seriously ill, compromised patients, including those who were debilitated, immunosuppressed, or neutropenic. Infections caused by aerobic gram\u2010negative and by mixtures of organisms resistant to other cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, or penicillins have responded to treatment with Cefizox. Because of the serious nature of some urinary tract infections due to P. aeruginosa and because many strains of Pseudomonas species are only moderately susceptible to Cefizox, higher dosage is recommended. Other therapy should be instituted if the response is not prompt. Susceptibility studies on specimens obtained prior to therapy should be used to determine the response of causative organisms to Cefizox. Therapy with Cefizox may be initiated pending results of the studies; however, treatment should be adjusted according to study findings. In serious infections, Cefizox has been used concomitantly with aminoglycosides (see PRECAUTIONS ). Before using Cefizox concomitantly with other antibiotics, the prescribing information for those agents should be reviewed for contraindications, warnings, precautions, and adverse reactions. Renal function should be carefully monitored. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Cefizox and other antibacterial drugs, Cefizox should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

IF THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE GIVEN TO PENICILLIN\u00adSENSITIVE PATIENTS, CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED BECAUSE CROSS HYPERSENSITIVITY AMONG BETA\u2010LACTAM ANTIBIOTICS HAS BEEN CLEARLY DOCUMENTED AND MAY OCCUR IN UP TO 10% OF PATIENTS WITH A HISTORY OF PENICILLIN ALLERGY. IF AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO CEFIZOX OCCURS, DISCONTINUE THE DRUG. SERIOUS ACUTE HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS MAY REQUIRE TREATMENT WITH EPINEPHRINE AND OTHER EMERGENCY MEASURES, INCLUDING OXYGEN, IV FLUIDS, IV ANTIHISTAMINES, CORTICOSTEROIDS, PRESSOR AMINES, AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT, AS CLINICALLY INDICATED. Pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including ceftizoxime, and may range in severity from mild to life threatening. Therefore, it is important to consider this diagnosis in patients who present with diarrhea subsequent to the administration of antibacterial agents. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of \u201cantibiotic\u2010associated\u201d colitis. After the diagnosis of pseudomembranous colitis has been established, appropriate therapeutic measures should be initiated. Mild cases of pseudomembranous colitis usually respond to drug discontinuation alone. In moderate to severe cases, consideration should be given to management with fluids and electrolytes, protein supplementation, and treatment with an antibacterial drug clinically effective against Clostridium difficile colitis."

        "Dosage and Administration Note: Cefizox (ceftizoxime for injection, USP) in the ADD-Vantage\u00ae vial is intended for intravenous infusion only after dilution with the appropriate volume of ADD-Vantage diluent solution. The usual adult dosage is 1 or 2 grams of Cefizox (ceftizoxime for injection, USP) every 8 to 12 hours. Proper dosage and route of administration should be determined by the condition of the patient, severity of the infection, and susceptibility of the causative organisms. General Guidelines for Dosage of Cefizox Type of Infection Daily Dose (Grams) Frequency and Route Uncomplicated Urinary Tract 1 500 mg q12h IM or IV Other Sites 2-3 1 gram q8-12h IM or IV Severe or Refractory 3-6 1 gram q8h IM or IV 2 grams q8-12h IM When administering 2 gram IM doses, the dose should be divided and given in different large muscle masses. or IV PID If C. trachomatis is a suspected pathogen, appropriate anti\u00adchlamydial coverage should be added, because ceftizoxime has no activity against this organism. 6 2 grams q8h IV Life-Threatening In life\u2010threatening infections, dosages up to 2 grams every 4 hours have been given. 9-12 3-4 grams q8h IV Because of the serious nature of urinary tract infections due to P. aeruginosa and because many strains of Pseudomonas species are only moderately susceptible to Cefizox, higher dosage is recommended. Other therapy should be instituted if the response is not prompt. A single, 1 gram IM dose is the usual dose for treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea. The IV route may be preferable for patients with bacterial septicemia, localized parenchymal abscesses (such as intra\u00adabdominal abscess), peritonitis, or other severe or life\u2010threatening infections. In those with normal renal function, the IV dosage for such infections is 2 to 12 grams of Cefizox (ceftizoxime for injection, USP) daily. In conditions such as bacterial septicemia, 6 to 12 grams/day may be given initially by the IV route for several days, and the dosage may then be gradually reduced according to clinical response and laboratory findings. Pediatric Dosage Schedule Unit Dose Frequency Pediatric patients 6 months or older 50 mg/kg q6-8h Dosage may be increased to a total daily dose of 200 mg/kg (not to exceed the maximum adult dose for serious infection). Impaired Renal Function Modification of Cefizox dosage is necessary in patients with impaired renal function. Following an initial loading dose of 500 mg-1 gram IM or IV, the maintenance dosing schedule shown below should be followed. Further dosing should be determined by therapeutic monitoring, severity of the infection, and susceptibility of the causative organisms. When only the serum creatinine level is available, creatinine clearance may be calculated from the following formula. The serum creatinine level should represent current renal function at the steady state. Males Clcr = Weight (kg) x (140 \u00ad age) 72 x serum creatinine (mg/100 mL) Females are 0.85 of the calculated clearance values for males. In patients undergoing hemodialysis, no additional supplemental dosing is required following hemodialysis; however, dosing should be timed so that the patient receives the dose (according to the table below) at the end of the dialysis. Dosage in Adults with Reduced Renal Function Creatinine Clearance mL/min Renal Function Less Severe Infections Life-Threatening Infections 79-50 Mild Impairment 500 mg q8h 0.75-1.5 grams q8h 49-5 Moderate to severe impairment 250-500 mg q12h 0.5-1 gram q12h 4-0 Dialysis Patients 500 mg q48h or 250 mg q24h 0.5-1 gram q48h or 0.5 gram q24h Reconstitution Cefizox in the ADD-Vantage vial is intended for use with ADD-Vantage diluent containers only, available in 50 mL and 100 mL sizes of Sodium Chloride Injection 0.9% and Dextrose Injection 5%. Ordinarily, the ADD-Vantage vials should be reconstituted only when it is certain that the patient is ready to receive the drug. However, reconstitued Cefizox is stable for 24 hours at room temperature or 96 hours under refrigeration 5\u00b0C (41\u00b0F). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. To Open ADD-Vantage \u00ae Diluent Containers Peel overwrap at corner and remove solution container. Some opacity of the plastic due to moisture absorption during the sterilization process may be observed. This is normal and does not affect the solution quality or safety. The opacity will diminish gradually. To Assemble Vial and Flexible Diluent Container (Use Aseptic Technique) 1. Remove the protective covers from the top of the vial and the vial port on the diluent container as follows: a. To remove the breakaway vial cap, swing the pull ring over the top of the vial and pull down far enough to start the opening (SEE FIGURE 1.), then pull straight up to remove the cap. (SEE FIGURE 2.) NOTE: Once the breakaway cap has been removed, do not access vial with syringe. b. To remove the vial port cover, grasp the tab on the pull ring, pull up to break the three tie strings, then pull further to remove the cover. (SEE FIGURE 3.) 2. Screw the vial into the vial port until it will go no further. THE VIAL MUST BE SCREWED IN TIGHTLY TO ASSURE A SEAL. This occurs approximately \u00bd turn (180\u00b0) after the first audible click. (SEE FIGURE 4.) The clicking sound does not assure a seal; the vial must be turned as far as it will go. NOTE: Once vial is sealed, do not attempt to remove. (SEE FIGURE 4.) 3. Recheck the vial to assure that it is tight by trying to turn it further in the direction of assembly. 4. Label appropriately. To Prepare Admixture Squeeze the bottom of the diluent container gently to inflate the portion of the container surrounding the end of the drug vial. With the other hand, push the drug vial down into the container telescoping the walls of the container. Grasp the inner cap of the vial through the walls of the container. (SEE FIGURE 5.) Pull the inner cap from the drug vial. (SEE FIGURE 6.) Verify that the rubber stopper has been pulled out, allowing the diluent to enter the drug vial and thoroughly dissolve the powder. Mix container contents thoroughly by inverting several times, and use within the specified time. Preparation for Administration (Use Aseptic Technique) Confirm the activation and admixture of vial contents. Check for leaks by squeezing container firmly. If leaks are found, discard unit as sterility may be impaired. Close flow control clamp of administration set. Remove cover from outlet port at bottom of container. Insert piercing pin of administration set into port with a twisting motion until the pin is firmly seated. NOTE: See full directions on administration set carton. Lift the free end of the hanger loop on the bottom of the vial, breaking the two tie strings. Bend the loop outward to lock it in the upright position, then suspend container from hanger. Squeeze and release drip chamber to establish proper fluid level in chamber. Open flow control clamp and clear air from set. Close clamp. Attach set to venipuncture device. If device is not indwelling, prime and make venipuncture. Regulate rate of administration with flow control clamp. WARNING: Do not use flexible container in series connections."

        "Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Cefizox should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Cefizox is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Cefizox or other antibacterial drugs in the future."

      "clinical_pharmacology": [
        "Clinical Pharmacology Following IV administration of 1, 2, and 3 gram doses of Cefizox to normal volunteers, the following serum levels were obtained. Serum Concentrations After Intravenous Administration Serum Concentration (\u00b5g/mL) Dose 5 min 10 min 30 min 1 hr 2 hr 4 hr 8 hr 1 gram Not Done 60.5 38.9 21.5 8.4 1.4 2 grams 131.8 110.9 77.5 53.6 33.1 12.1 2.0 3 grams 221.1 174.0 112.7 83.9 47.4 26.2 4.8 A serum half\u2010life of approximately 1.7 hours was observed after IV or IM administration. Cefizox is 30% protein bound. Cefizox is not metabolized, and is excreted virtually unchanged by the kidneys in 24 hours. This provides a high urinary concentration. Concentrations greater than 6000 \u03bcg/mL have been achieved in the urine by 2 hours after a 1 gram dose of Cefizox intravenously. Probenecid slows tubular secretion and produces even higher serum levels, increasing the duration of measurable serum concentrations. Cefizox achieves therapeutic levels in various body fluids, e.g., cerebrospinal fluid (in patients with inflamed meninges), bile, surgical wound fluid, pleural fluid, aqueous humor, ascitic fluid, peritoneal fluid, prostatic fluid and saliva, and in the following body tissues: heart, gallbladder, bone, biliary, peritoneal, prostatic, and uterine. In clinical experience to date, no disulfiram\u2010like reactions have been reported with Cefizox. Microbiology The bactericidal action of Ceftizoxime results from inhibition of cell\u2010wall synthesis. Ceftizoxime is highly resistant to a broad spectrum of beta\u2010lactamases (penicillinase and cephalosporinase), including Richmond types I, II, III, TEM, and IV, produced by both aerobic and anaerobic gram\u2010positive and gram\u2010negative organisms. Ceftizoxime has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section: Aerobic Gram-Positive Microorganisms Staphylococcus aureus (including penicillinase producing strains) NOTE: Methicillin\u00adresistant staphylococci are resistant to cephalosporins, including ceftizoxime. Staphylococcus epidermidis (including penicillinase producing strains) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus pyogenes NOTE: A streptococcal isolate that is susceptible to penicillin can be considered susceptible to ceftizoxime 4 . NOTE: Ceftizoxime is usually inactive against most strains of Enterococcus faecalis. Aerobic Gram-Negative Microorganisms Enterobacter spp. Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin\u00adresistant strains) Klebsiella pneumoniae Morganella morganii Neisseria gonorrhoeae Proteus mirabilis Proteus vulgaris Providencia rettgeri Pseudomonas aeruginosa Serratia marcescens Anaerobic Microorganisms Bacteroides spp. Peptococcus spp. Peptostreptococcus spp. The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown . At least 90% of the following microorganisms exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for ceftizoxime. However, the safety and effectiveness of ceftizoxime in treating clinical infections due to these microorganisms have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Aerobic Gram-Negative Microorganisms Aeromonas hydrophila Citrobacter spp. Moraxella catarrhalis Neisseria meningitidis Providencia stuartii Susceptibility Testing Methods: Dilution techniques: Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized procedure. Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method 1 (broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of ceftizoxime powder. The MIC values should be interpreted according to the following criteria: For testing non-fastidious aerobic microorganisms other than Haemophilus spp., Neisseria gonorrhoeae : MIC (\u03bcg/mL) Interpretation \u22648 Susceptible (S) 16-32 Intermediate (I) \u226564 Resistant (R) For testing Haemophilus spp. These interpretative standards are applicable only to broth microdilution susceptibility testing with Haemophilus spp. using Haemophilus Test Medium. 2 MIC (\u03bcg/mL) Interpretation The current absence of data on resistant strains precludes defining any category other than \u201csusceptible\u201d. Strains yielding MIC results suggestive of a \u201cnonsusceptible\u201d category should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing. \u22642 Susceptible (S) For testing Neisseria gonorrhoeae These interpretative standards are applicable only to agar dilution susceptibility testing using GC agar base and 1% defined growth supplements. MIC (\u03bcg/mL) Interpretation \u22640.5 Susceptible (S) A report of \u201cSusceptible\u201d indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable. A report of \u201cIntermediate\u201d indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone, which prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of \u201cResistant\u201d indicates that the pathogen is not likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable, other therapy should be selected. Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. Standard ceftizoxime powder should provide the following MIC values: Microorganism MIC(\u03bcg/mL) Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 0.03\u20100.12 Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247 0.06-0.5 Neisseria gonorrhoeae ATCC 49226 0.008-0.03 Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 16-64 Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 2\u20108 Diffusion Techniques: Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. One such standardized procedure 2 requires the use of standardized inoculum concentrations. This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 30-\u03bcg ceftizoxime to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to ceftizoxime. Reports from the laboratory providing results of the standard single-disk susceptibility test with a 30-\u03bcg ceftizoxime disk should be interpreted according to the following criteria: Zone diameter interpretative standard for testing non-fastidious aerobic microorganisms other than Haemophilus spp. and Neisseria gonorrhoeae : Zone Diameter (mm) Interpretation \u2265 20 Susceptible (S) 15-19 Intermediate (I) \u2264 14 Resistant (R) Zone diameter interpretative standard for testing Haemophilus spp. These zone diameter standards are applicable only to susceptibility testing with Haemophilus spp. using Haemophilus Test Medium. 3 Zone Diameter (mm) Interpretation The current absence of data on resistant strains precludes defining any category other than \u201csusceptible\u201d. Strains yielding MIC results suggestive of a \u201cnonsusceptible\u201d category should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing. \u2265 26 Susceptible (S) Zone diameter interpretative standard for testing Neisseria gonorrhoeae . These interpretative standards are applicable only to disk diffusion testing using GC agar base and 1% defined growth supplements incubated at 5% CO 2 . Zone Diameter (mm) Interpretation \u2265 38 Susceptible (S) Interpretation should be as stated above for results using dilution techniques. Interpretation involves correlation of the diameter obtained in the disk test with the MIC for ceftizoxime. As with standardized dilution techniques, diffusion methods require the use of laboratory control microorganisms that are used to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. For the diffusion technique, the 30-\u03bcg ceftizoxime disk should provide the following zone diameters in these laboratory test quality control strains: Microorganism Zone Diameter (mm) Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 30-36 Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247 29-39 Neisseria gonorrhoeae ATCC 49226 42-51 Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 12-17 Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 27-35 Anaerobic Techniques: For anaerobic bacteria, the susceptibility to ceftizoxime as MICs can be determined by standardized test methods. Agar dilution results can vary widely when using ceftizoxime. It is recommended that broth microdilution method be used when possible. 3 The MIC values obtained should be interpreted according to the following criteria: MIC(\u03bc g/mL) Broth dilution Agar dilution Interpretation \u2264 16 \u2264 32 Susceptible (S) 32 64 Intermediate (I) \u2265 64 \u2265 128 Resistant (R) Interpretation is identical to that described in Susceptibility Testing: Dilution Techniques. As with other susceptibility techniques, the use of laboratory control microorganisms is required to control the technical aspects of the laboratory standardized procedures. Standardized ceftizoxime powder should provide the following MIC values: Microorganism MIC(\u03bcg/mL) Broth dilution Agar dilution Eubacterium lentum ATCC 43055 16-64 16-64 Bacteriodes thetaiotaomicron ATCC 29741 --- 4-16 Susceptibility Testing for Pseu domonas in Urinary Tract Infections Most strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are moderately susceptible to ceftizoxime. Ceftizoxime achieves high levels in the urine (greater than 6000 mcg/mL at 2 hours with 1 gram IV) and, therefore, the following zone sizes should be used when testing ceftizoxime for treatment of urinary tract infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Susceptible organisms produce zones of 20 mm or greater, indicating that the test organism is likely to respond to therapy. Organisms that produce zones of 11 to 19 mm are expected to be susceptible when the infection is confined to the urinary tract (in which high antibiotic levels are attained). Resistant organisms produce zones of 10 mm or less, indicating that other therapy should be selected."

      "clinical_pharmacology": [
        "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Cyclosporine is a potent immunosuppressive agent, which in animals prolongs survival of allogeneic transplants involving skin, heart, kidney, pancreas, bone marrow, small intestine, and lung. Cyclosporine has been demonstrated to suppress some humoral immunity and to a greater extent, cell-mediated reactions, such as allograft rejection, delayed hypersensitivity, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, Freund's adjuvant arthritis, and graft vs. host disease in many animal species for a variety of organs. Successful kidney, liver, and heart allogeneic transplants have been performed in man using cyclosporine. The exact mechanism of action of cyclosporine is not known. Experimental evidence suggests that the effectiveness of cyclosporine is due to specific and reversible inhibition of immunocompetent lymphocytes in the G 0 - or G 1 -phase of the cell cycle. T-lymphocytes are preferentially inhibited. The T-helper cell is the main target, although the T-suppressor cell may also be suppressed. Cyclosporine also inhibits lymphokine production and release, including interleukin-2 or T-cell growth factor (TCGF). No functional effects on phagocytic (changes in enzyme secretions not altered, chemotactic migration of granulocytes, macrophage migration, carbon clearance in vivo ) or tumor cells (growth rate, metastasis) can be detected in animals. Cyclosporine does not cause bone marrow suppression in animal models or man. The absorption of cyclosporine from the gastrointestinal tract is incomplete and variable. Peak concentrations (C max ) in blood and plasma are achieved at about 3.5 hours. C max and area under the plasma or blood concentration/time curve (AUC) increase with the administered dose; for blood, the relationship is curvilinear (parabolic) between 0 and 1400 mg. As determined by a specific assay, C max is approximately 1.0 ng/mL/mg of dose for plasma and 2.7 to 1.4 ng/mL/mg of dose for blood (for low to high doses). Cyclosporine is distributed largely outside the blood volume. In blood, the distribution is concentration dependent. Approximately 33% to 47% is in plasma, 4% to 9% in lymphocytes, 5% to 12% in granulocytes, and 41% to 58% in erythrocytes. At high concentrations, the uptake by leukocytes and erythrocytes becomes saturated. In plasma, approximately 90% is bound to proteins, primarily lipoproteins. The disposition of cyclosporine from blood is biphasic with a terminal half-life of approximately 19 hours (range, 10 to 27 hours). Elimination is primarily biliary with only 6% of the dose excreted in the urine. Cyclosporine is extensively metabolized but there is no major metabolic pathway. Only 0.1% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Of 15 metabolites characterized in human urine, 9 have been assigned structures. The major pathways consist of hydroxylation of the C\u03b3-carbon of 2 of the leucine residues, C\u03b7-carbon hydroxylation, and cyclic ether formation (with oxidation of the double bond) in the side chain of the amino acid 3-hydroxyl- N ,4-dimethyl-L-2-amino-6-octenoic acid and N -demethylation of N -methyl leucine residues. Hydrolysis of the cyclic peptide chain or conjugation of the aforementioned metabolites do not appear to be important biotransformation pathways. Specific Populations Renal Impairment In a study performed in 4 subjects with end-stage renal disease (creatinine clearance < 5mL/min), an intravenous infusion of 3.5 mg/kg of cyclosporine over 4 hours administered at the end of a hemodialysis session resulted in a mean volume of distribution (Vdss) of 3.49 L/kg and systemic clearance (CL) of 0.369 L/hr/kg. This systemic CL (0.369 L/hr/kg) was approximately two thirds of the mean systemic CL (0.56 L/hr/kg) of cyclosporine in historical control subjects with normal renal function. In 5 liver transplant patients, the mean clearance of cyclosporine on and off hemodialysis was 463 mL/min and 398 mL/min, respectively. Less than 1% of the dose of cyclosporine was recovered in the dialysate. Hepatic Impairment Cyclosporine is extensively metabolized by the liver. Since severe hepatic impairment may result in significantly increased cyclosporine exposures, the dosage of cyclosporine may need to be reduced in these patients."

        "WARNINGS Kidney, Liver, and Heart Transplant Cyclosporine, when used in high doses, can cause hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity ( see BOXED WARNING ). Nephrotoxicity It is not unusual for serum creatinine and BUN levels to be elevated during cyclosporine therapy. These elevations in renal transplant patients do not necessarily indicate rejection, and each patient must be fully evaluated before dosage adjustment is initiated. Nephrotoxicity has been noted in 25% of cases of renal transplantation, 38% of cases of cardiac transplantation, and 37% of cases of liver transplantation. Mild nephrotoxicity was generally noted 2 to 3 months after transplant and consisted of an arrest in the fall of the preoperative elevations of BUN and creatinine at a range of 35 to 45 mg/dl and 2.0 to 2.5 mg/dl, respectively. These elevations were often responsive to dosage reduction. More overt nephrotoxicity was seen early after transplantation and was characterized by a rapidly rising BUN and creatinine. Since these events are similar to rejection episodes, care must be taken to differentiate between them. This form of nephrotoxicity is usually responsive to cyclosporine dosage reduction. Although specific diagnostic criteria which reliably differentiate renal graft rejection from drug toxicity have not been found, a number of parameters have been significantly associated to one or the other. It should be noted however, that up to 20% of patients may have simultaneous nephrotoxicity and rejection. Nephrotoxicity vs. Rejection Parameter Nephrotoxicity Rejection a p < 0.05, b p < 0.01, c p < 0.001, d p < 0.0001.

From 5% to 15% of transplant recipients will fail to show a reduction in a rising serum creatinine despite a decrease or discontinuation of cyclosporine therapy. Renal biopsies from these patients will demonstrate an interstitial fibrosis with tubular atrophy. In addition, toxic tubulopathy, peritubular capillary congestion, arteriolopathy, and a striped form of interstitial fibrosis with tubular atrophy may be present. Though none of these morphologic changes is entirely specific, a histologic diagnosis of chronic progressive cyclosporine-associated nephrotoxicity requires evidence of these. When considering the development of chronic nephrotoxicity it is noteworthy that several authors have reported an association between the appearance of interstitial fibrosis and higher cumulative doses or persistently high circulating trough concentrations of cyclosporine. This is particularly true during the first 6 posttransplant months when the dosage tends to be highest and when, in kidney recipients, the organ appears to be most vulnerable to the toxic effects of cyclosporine. Among other contributing factors to the development of interstitial fibrosis in these patients must be included, prolonged perfusion time, warm ischemia time, as well as episodes of acute toxicity, and acute and chronic rejection. The reversibility of interstitial fibrosis and its correlation to renal function have not yet been determined. Impaired renal function at any time requires close monitoring, and frequent dosage adjustment may be indicated. In patients with persistent high elevations of BUN and creatinine who are unresponsive to dosage adjustments, consideration should be given to switching to other immunosuppressive therapy. In the event of severe and unremitting rejection, it is preferable to allow the kidney transplant to be rejected and removed rather than increase the cyclosporine dosage to a very high level in an attempt to reverse the rejection. Due to the potential for additive or synergistic impairment of renal function, caution should be exercised when coadministering cyclosporine with other drugs that may impair renal function (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions ) . Thrombotic Microangiopathy Occasionally patients have developed a syndrome of thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia which may result in graft failure. The vasculopathy can occur in the absence of rejection and is accompanied by avid platelet consumption within the graft as demonstrated by Indium 111 labeled platelet studies. Neither the pathogenesis nor the management of this syndrome is clear. Though resolution has occurred after reduction or discontinuation of cyclosporine and 1) administration of streptokinase and heparin or 2) plasmapheresis, this appears to depend upon early detection with Indium 111 labeled platelet scans (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Hyperkalemia Significant hyperkalemia (sometimes associated with hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis) and hyperuricemia have been seen occasionally in individual patients. Hepatotoxicity Cases of hepatotoxicity and liver injury, including cholestasis, jaundice, hepatitis, and liver failure have been reported in patients treated with cyclosporine. Most reports included patients with significant co-morbidities, underlying conditions and other confounding factors, including infectious complications and comedications with hepatotoxic potential. In some cases, mainly in transplant patients, fatal outcomes have been reported (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Postmarketing Experience ). Hepatotoxicity, usually manifested by elevations in hepatic enzymes and bilirubin, was reported in patients treated with cyclosporine in clinical trials: 4% in renal transplantation, 7% in cardiac transplantation, and 4% in liver transplantation. This was usually noted during the first month of therapy when high doses of cyclosporine were used. The chemistry elevations usually decreased with a reduction in dosage. Malignancies As in patients receiving other immunosuppressants, those patients receiving cyclosporine are at increased risk for development of lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly those of the skin. The increased risk appears related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of specific agents. Because of the danger of oversuppression of the immune system, which can also increase susceptibility to infection, cyclosporine should not be administered with other immunosuppressive agents except adrenal corticosteroids. The efficacy and safety of cyclosporine in combination with other immunosuppressive agents have not been determined. Some malignancies may be fatal. Transplant patients receiving cyclosporine are at increased risk for serious infection with fatal outcome. Serious Infections Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including cyclosporine, are at increased risk of developing bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal infections, including opportunistic infections. These infections may lead to serious, including fatal, outcomes (see BOXED WARNING , and ADVERSE REACTIONS ) . Polyoma Virus Infections Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including cyclosporine, are at increased risk for opportunistic infections, including polyoma virus infections. Polyoma virus infections in transplant patients may have serious, and sometimes, fatal outcomes. These include cases of JC virus-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), and polyoma virus-associated nephropathy (PVAN), especially due to BK virus infection, which have been observed in patients receiving cyclosporine. PVAN is associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss, (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Postmarketing Experience ) . Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for PVAN. Cases of PML have been reported in patients treated with cyclosporine. PML, which is sometimes fatal, commonly presents with hemiparesis, apathy, confusion, cognitive deficiencies, and ataxia. Risk factors for PML include treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. In immunosuppressed patients, physicians should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients reporting neurological symptoms and consultation with a neurologist should be considered as clinically indicated. Consideration should be given to reducing the total immunosuppression in transplant patients who develop PML or PVAN. However, reduced immunosuppression may place the graft at risk. Neurotoxicity There have been reports of convulsions in adult and pediatric patients receiving cyclosporine, particularly in combination with high-dose methylprednisolone. Encephalopathy, including Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES), has been described both in postmarketing reports and in the literature. Manifestations include impaired consciousness, convulsions, visual disturbances (including blindness), loss of motor function, movement disorders, and psychiatric disturbances. In many cases, changes in the white matter have been detected using imaging techniques and pathologic specimens. Predisposing factors such as hypertension, hypomagnesemia, hypocholesterolemia, high-dose corticosteroids, high cyclosporine blood concentrations, and graft-versus-host disease have been noted in many but not all of the reported cases. The changes in most cases have been reversible upon discontinuation of cyclosporine, and in some cases, improvement was noted after reduction of dose. It appears that patients receiving liver transplant are more susceptible to encephalopathy than those receiving kidney transplant. Another rare manifestation of cyclosporine-induced neurotoxicity is optic disc edema, including papilloedema, with possible visual impairment, secondary to benign intracranial hypertension. Specific Excipients Anaphylactic Reactions Rarely (approximately 1 in 1000), patients receiving cyclosporine injection have experienced anaphylactic reactions. Although the exact cause of these reactions is unknown, it is believed to be due to the Cremophor \u00ae EL (polyoxyethylated castor oil) used as the vehicle for the intravenous (IV) formulation. These reactions can consist of flushing of the face and upper thorax, and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, with acute respiratory distress, dyspnea, wheezing, blood pressure changes, and tachycardia. One patient died after respiratory arrest and aspiration pneumonia. In some cases, the reaction subsided after the infusion was stopped. Patients receiving cyclosporine injection should be under continuous observation for at least the first 30 minutes following the start of the infusion and at frequent intervals thereafter. If anaphylaxis occurs, the infusion should be stopped. An aqueous solution of epinephrine 1:1000 should be available at the bedside as well as a source of oxygen. Anaphylactic reactions have not been reported with the soft gelatin capsules or oral solution which lack Cremophor \u00ae EL (polyoxyethylated castor oil). In fact, patients experiencing anaphylactic reactions have been treated subsequently with the soft gelatin capsules or oral solution without incident. Alcohol (ethanol) The alcohol content (see DESCRIPTION ) of cyclosporine should be taken into account when given to patients in whom alcohol intake should be avoided or minimized, e.g. pregnant or breastfeeding women, in patients presenting with liver disease or epilepsy, in alcoholic patients, or pediatric patients. Care should be taken in using cyclosporine with nephrotoxic drugs (see PRECAUTIONS )."

        "PRECAUTIONS Hypertension Hypertension is a common side effect of cyclosporine therapy (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Mild or moderate hypertension is more frequently encountered than severe hypertension and the incidence decreases over time. Antihypertensive therapy may be required. Control of blood pressure can be accomplished with any of the common antihypertensive agents. However, since cyclosporine may cause hyperkalemia, potassium-sparing diuretics should not be used. While calcium antagonists can be effective agents in treating cyclosporine-associated hypertension, care should be taken since interference with cyclosporine metabolism may require a dosage adjustment (see Drug Interactions ). Vaccination During treatment with cyclosporine, vaccination may be less effective and the use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided. Information for Patients Patients should be advised that any change of cyclosporine formulation should be made cautiously and only under physician supervision because it may result in the need for a change in dosage. Patients should be informed of the necessity of repeated laboratory tests while they are receiving the drug. They should be given careful dosage instructions, advised of the potential risks during pregnancy, and informed of the increased risk of neoplasia. Cyclosporine may impact the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised to exercise care when driving or using machines if they experience neurological disturbances including confusion, somnolence, or dizziness and discuss with their healthcare provider (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Laboratory Tests Renal and liver functions should be assessed repeatedly by measurement of BUN, serum creatinine, serum bilirubin, and liver enzymes. Drug Interactions A. Effect of Drugs and Other Agents on Cyclosporine Pharmacokinetics and/or Safety All of the individual drugs cited below are well substantiated to interact with cyclosporine. In addition, concomitant use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with cyclosporine, particularly in the setting of dehydration, may potentiate renal dysfunction. Caution should be exercised when using other drugs which are known to impair renal function (see WARNINGS , Nephrotoxicity ) . Drugs That May Potentiate Renal Dysfunction Antibiotics Antineoplastics Antifungals Anti-Inflammatory Drugs Gastrointestinal Agents Immunosuppressives Other Drugs ciprofloxacin melphalan amphotericin B azapropazon cimetidine tacrolimus fibric acid derivatives (e.g., bezafibrate, fenofibrate) gentamicin ketoconazole colchicine ranitidine methotrexate tobramycin diclofenac trimethoprim with sulfamethoxazole naproxen vancomycin sulindac During the concomitant use of a drug that may exhibit additive or synergistic renal impairment potential with cyclosporine, close monitoring of renal function (in particular serum creatinine) should be performed. If a significant impairment of renal function occurs, reduction in the dosage of cyclosporine and/or coadministered drug or an alternative treatment should be considered. Cyclosporine is extensively metabolized by CYP 3A isoenzymes, in particular CYP3A4, and is a substrate of the multidrug efflux transporter P-glycoprotein. Various agents are known to either increase or decrease plasma or whole blood concentrations of cyclosporine usually by inhibition or induction of CYP3A4 or P-glycoprotein transporter or both. Compounds that decrease cyclosporine absorption, such as orlistat, should be avoided. Appropriate cyclosporine dosage adjustment to achieve the desired cyclosporine concentrations is essential when drugs that significantly alter cyclosporine concentrations are used concomitantly (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , Blood Concentration Monitoring ). 1. Drugs That Increase Cyclosporine Concentrations Calcium Channel Blockers Antifungals Antibiotics Glucocorticoids Other Drugs diltiazem fluconazole azithromycin methylprednisolone allopurinol nicardipine itraconazole clarithromycin amiodarone verapamil ketoconazole erythromycin bromocriptine voriconazole quinupristin/ colchicine dalfopristin danazol imatinib metoclopramide nefazodone oral contraceptives HIV Protease inhibitors The HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir) are known to inhibit cytochrome P-450 3A and thus could potentially increase the concentrations of cyclosporine, however, no formal studies of the interaction are available. Care should be exercised when these drugs are administered concomitantly. Grapefruit juice Grapefruit and grapefruit juice affect metabolism, increasing blood concentrations of cyclosporine, thus should be avoided. 2. Drugs/Dietary Supplements That Decrease Cyclosporine Concentrations Antibiotics Anticonvulsants Other Drugs/Dietary Supplements nafcillin carbamazepine bosentan rifampin oxcarbazepine octreotide phenobarbital orlistat phenytoin sulfinpyrazone terbinafine ticlopidine St. John's Wort Bosentan Co-administration of bosentan (250 to 1000 mg every 12 hours based on tolerability) and cyclosporine (300 mg every 12 hours for 2 days then dosing to achieve a C min of 200 to 250 ng/mL) for 7 days in healthy subjects resulted in decreases in the cyclosporine mean dose-normalized AUC, C max , and trough concentration of approximately 50%, 30% and 60%, respectively, compared to when cyclosporine was given alone (see also Effect of Cyclosporine on the Pharmacokinetics and/or Safety of Other Drugs or Agents) . Coadministration of cyclosporine with bosentan should be avoided. Boceprevir Coadministration of boceprevir (800 mg three times daily for 7 days) and cyclosporine (100 mg single dose) in healthy subjects resulted in increases in the mean AUC and C max of cyclosporine approximately 2.7-fold and 2-fold, respectively, compared to when cyclosporine was given alone. Telaprevir Coadministration of telaprevir (750 mg every 8 hours for 11 days) with cyclosporine (10 mg on Day 8) in healthy subjects resulted in increases in the mean dose-normalized AUC and C max of cyclosporine approximately 4.5-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively, compared to when cyclosporine (100 mg single dose) was given alone. St. John\u2019s Wort There have been reports of a serious drug interaction between cyclosporine and the herbal dietary supplement, St. John\u2019s Wort. This interaction has been reported to produce a marked reduction in the blood concentrations of cyclosporine, resulting in subtherapeutic levels, rejection of transplanted organs, and graft loss. Rifabutin Rifabutin is known to increase the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P-450 system. The interaction between rifabutin and cyclosporine has not been studied. Care should be exercised when these two drugs are administered concomitantly. B. Effect of Cyclosporine on the Pharmacokinetics and/or Safety of Other Drugs or Agents Cyclosporine is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and of multiple drug efflux transporters (e.g., P-glycoprotein) and may increase plasma concentrations of comedications that are substrates of CYP3A4, P-glycoprotein, or organic anion transporter proteins. Cyclosporine may reduce the clearance of digoxin, colchicine, prednisolone, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and aliskiren, bosentan, dabigatran, repaglinide, NSAIDs, sirolimus, etoposide, and other drugs. See the full prescribing information of the other drug for further information and specific recommendations. The decision on coadministration of cyclosporine with other drugs or agents should be made by the healthcare provider following the careful assessment of benefits and risks. Digoxin Severe digitalis toxicity has been seen within days of starting cyclosporine in several patients taking digoxin. If digoxin is used concurrently with cyclosporine, serum digoxin concentrations should be monitored. Colchicine There are reports on the potential of cyclosporine to enhance the toxic effects of colchicine, such as myopathy and neuropathy, especially in patients with renal dysfunction. Concomitant administration of cyclosporine and colchicine results in significant increases in colchicine plasma concentrations. If colchicine is used concurrently with cyclosporine, a reduction in the dosage of colchicine is recommended. HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors (statins) Literature and postmarketing cases of myotoxicity, including muscle pain and weakness, myositis, and rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with concomitant administration of cyclosporine with lovastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin, and rarely, fluvastatin. When concurrently administered with cyclosporine, the dosage of these statins should be reduced according to label recommendations. Statin therapy needs to be temporarily withheld or discontinued in patients with signs and symptoms of myopathy or those with risk factors predisposing to severe renal injury, including renal failure, secondary to rhabdomyolysis. Repaglinide Cyclosporine may increase the plasma concentrations of repaglinide and thereby increase the risk of hypoglycemia. In 12 healthy male subjects who received two doses of 100 mg cyclosporine capsule orally 12 hours apart with a single dose of 0.25 mg repaglinide tablet (one half of a 0.5 mg tablet) orally 13 hours after the cyclosporine initial dose, the repaglinide mean C max and AUC were increased 1.8-fold (range, 0.6 to 3.7-fold) and 2.4 fold (range, 1.2 to 5.3 fold), respectively. Close monitoring of blood glucose level is advisable for a patient taking cyclosporine and repaglinide concomitantly. Ambrisentan Coadministration of ambrisentan (5 mg daily) and cyclosporine (100 to 150 mg twice daily initially, then dosing to achieve C min 150 to 200 ng/mL) for 8 days in healthy subjects resulted mean increases in ambrisentan AUC and C max of approximately 2-fold and 1.5-fold, respectively, compared to ambrisentan alone. When coadministering ambrisentan with cyclosporine, the ambrisentan dose should not be titrated to the recommended maximum daily dose. Anthracycline antibiotics High doses of cyclosporine (e.g., at starting intravenous dose of 16 mg/kg/day) may increase the exposure to anthracycline antibiotics (e.g., doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, daunorubicin) in cancer patients. Aliskiren Cyclosporine alters the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren, a substrate of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4. In 14 healthy subjects who received concomitantly single doses of cyclosporine (200 mg) and reduced dose aliskiren (75 mg), the mean C max of aliskiren was increased by approximately 2.5-fold (90% CI: 1.96 to 3.17) and the mean AUC by approximately 4.3-fold (90% CI: 3.52 to 5.21), compared to when these subjects received aliskiren alone. The concomitant administration of aliskiren with cyclosporine prolonged the median aliskiren elimination half-life (26 hours versus 43 to 45 hours) and the T max (0.5 hours versus 1.5 to 2.0 hours). The mean AUC and C max of cyclosporine were comparable to reported literature values. Coadministration of cyclosporine and aliskiren in these subjects also resulted in an increase in the number and/or intensity of adverse events, mainly headache, hot flush, nausea, vomiting, and somnolence. The coadministration of cyclosporine with aliskiren is not recommended. Bosentan In healthy subjects, coadministration of bosentan and cyclosporine resulted in time-dependent mean increases in dose-normalized bosentan trough concentrations (i.e., approximately 21-fold on Day 1 and 2-fold on Day 8 (steady state)) compared to when bosentan was given alone as a single dose on Day 1 (see also Effect of Drugs and Other Agents on Cyclosporine Pharmacokinetics and/or Safety) . Coadministration of cyclosporine with bosentan should be avoided. Dabigatran The effect of cyclosporine on dabigatran concentrations had not been formally studied. Concomitant administration of dabigatran and cyclosporine may result in increased plasma dabigatran concentrations due to the P-gp inhibitory activity of cyclosporine. Coadministration of cyclosporine with dabigatran should be avoided. Potassium sparing diuretics Cyclosporine should not be used with potassium-sparing diuretics because hyperkalemia can occur. Caution is also required when cyclosporine is coadministered with potassium-sparing drugs (e.g., angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists), potassium-containing drugs as well as in patients on a potassium-rich diet. Control of potassium levels in these situations is advisable. Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug (NSAID) Interactions Clinical status and serum creatinine should be closely monitored when cyclosporine is used with NSAIDs in rheumatoid arthritis patients (see WARNINGS ) . Pharmacodynamic interactions have been reported to occur between cyclosporine and both naproxen and sulindac, in that concomitant use is associated with additive decreases in renal function, as determined by 99m Tc-diethylenetriaminepenta acetic acid (DTPA) and ( p -aminohippuric acid) PAH clearances. Although concomitant administration of diclofenac does not affect blood concentrations of cyclosporine, it has been associated with approximate doubling of diclofenac blood levels and occasional reports of reversible decreases in renal function. Consequently, the dose of diclofenac should be in the lower end of the therapeutic range. Methotrexate Interaction Preliminary data indicate that when methotrexate and cyclosporine were coadministered to rheumatoid arthritis patients (N = 20), methotrexate concentrations (AUCs) were increased approximately 30% and the concentrations (AUCs) of its metabolite, 7-hydroxy methotrexate, were decreased by approximately 80%. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. Cyclosporine concentrations do not appear to have been altered (N = 6). Sirolimus Elevations in serum creatinine were observed in studies using sirolimus in combination with full-dose cyclosporine. This effect is often reversible with cyclosporine dose reduction. Simultaneous coadministration of cyclosporine significantly increases blood levels of sirolimus. To minimize increases in sirolimus blood concentrations, it is recommended that sirolimus be given 4 hours after cyclosporine administration. Nifedipine Frequent gingival hyperplasia when nifedipine is given concurrently with cyclosporine has been reported. The concomitant use of nifedipine should be avoided in patients in whom gingival hyperplasia develops as a side effect of cyclosporine. Methylprednisolone Convulsions when high dose methylprednisolone is given concomitantly with cyclosporine have been reported. Other Immunosuppressive Drugs and Agents Psoriasis patients receiving other immunosuppressive agents or radiation therapy (including PUVA and UVB) should not receive concurrent cyclosporine because of the possibility of excessive immunosuppression. Interactions resulting in decrease of other drug levels Cyclosporine inhibits the enterohepatic circulation of mycophenolic acid (MPA). Concomitant administration of cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil or mycophenolate sodium in transplant patients may decrease the mean exposure of MPA by 20 \u2013 50% when compared with other immunosuppressants, which could reduce efficacy of mycophenolate mofetil or mycophenolate sodium. Monitor patients for alterations in efficacy of mycophenolate mofetil or mycophenolate sodium, when they are co-administered with cyclosporine. C. Effect of Cyclosporine on the Efficacy of Live Vaccines During treatment with cyclosporine, vaccination may be less effective. The use of live vaccines should be avoided.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility Cyclosporine gave no evidence of mutagenic or teratogenic effects in appropriate test systems. Only at dose levels toxic to dams, were adverse effects seen in reproduction studies in rats (see P regnancy ) . Carcinogenicity studies were carried out in male and female rats and mice. In the 78-week mouse study, at doses of 1, 4, and 16 mg/kg/day, evidence of a statistically significant trend was found for lymphocytic lymphomas in females, and the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas in mid-dose (0.03 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area (BSA)) males significantly exceeded the control value. In the 24-month rat study, conducted at 0.5, 2, and 8 mg/kg/day, pancreatic islet cell adenomas significantly exceeded the control rate in the low-dose level (0.006 times the MRHD based on BSA). The hepatocellular carcinomas and pancreatic islet cell adenomas were not dose related. Cyclosporine has not been found mutagenic/genotoxic in the Ames test, the V79-HGPRT Test, the micronucleus test in mice and Chinese hamsters, the chromosome-aberration tests in Chinese hamster bone marrow, the mouse dominant lethal assay, and the DNA-repair test in sperm from treated mice. A recent study analyzing sister chromatid exchange (SCE) induction by cyclosporine using human lymphocytes in vitro gave indication of a positive effect (i.e., induction of SCE), at high concentrations in this system. In a fertility study in rats, increased perinatal mortality and impaired postnatal development of F1 pups were observed at 15 mg/kg/day (0.2 times the MRHD based on BSA). No adverse effects on fertility and reproduction were observed up to 5 mg/kg/day (0.06 times the MRHD based on BSA) in male and female rats. An increased incidence of malignancy is a recognized complication of immunosuppression in recipients of organ transplants. The most common forms of neoplasms are non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and carcinomas of the skin. The risk of malignancies in cyclosporine recipients is higher than in the normal, healthy population, but similar to that in patients receiving other immunosuppressive therapies. It has been reported that reduction or discontinuance of immunosuppression may cause the lesions to regress. Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to cyclosporine, including cyclosporine MODIFIED, during pregnancy. Encourage women who are taking cyclosporine MODIFIED during pregnancy to enroll in the Transplant Pregnancy Registry International (TPRI) by calling 1-877-955-8677 or visiting https://www.transplantpregnancyregistry.org . Risk Summary Available data from published literature, including the Transplant Pregnancy Registry International, observational cohort studies, case-controlled studies, meta-analysis, case series, and case reports, over decades of use with cyclosporine in pregnancy have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, or miscarriage. Adverse maternal or fetal outcomes including hypertension, preeclampsia, preterm birth, and low birth weight are increased in patients treated with cyclosporine. However, patients receiving cyclosporine during pregnancy have underlying medical conditions and may be treated with concomitant medications that limit the interpretability of these findings (see Data) . Embryo-fetal developmental (EFD) studies in rats and rabbits with cyclosporine have shown embryo-fetal toxicity at dose levels below the MRHD based on BSA. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Available data from the National Transplantation Pregnancy Registry (NTPR) including 622 pregnancies in renal, liver, and heart transplant recipients exposed to cyclosporine during pregnancy found that the overall rate of major birth defects, live birth rates, and miscarriage rates were comparable to the general population. Maternal and fetal adverse outcomes, including the rate of hypertension, preeclampsia, premature births, and low birth weight infants appear to be increased in transplant recipients treated with cyclosporine compared to the general population. However, these patients have underlying medical conditions that confound the above findings. Animal Data Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity in rats and rabbits. Three EFD studies (two oral and one intravenous) are available in rats. In two EFD studies, pregnant rats were orally administered with cyclosporine either at doses of 10, 17, 30, 100 and 300 mg/kg/day or 4, 10 and 25 mg/kg/day from gestation day (GD) 6 to 15 or from GD 7 to 17, respectively. Maternal toxicity characterized by mortality, clinical signs of toxicity and impaired body weight gain were observed at 30 mg/kg/day and above. Cyclosporine was embryo- and fetotoxic as indicated by increased embryonic mortality and reduced fetal weight together with skeletal retardations in rats at 25 mg/kg/day and above. In addition, ventricular septal defect was observed at 25 mg/kg/day in fetuses. In the first study, the oral no observed effect level (NOEL) for both dams and fetuses was 17 mg/kg/day (0.2 times the MRHD based on BSA). In the other oral study, the NOEL for dams and fetuses were 10 and 4 mg/kg/day (0.13 and 0.05 times the MRHD based on BSA), respectively. In the IV EFD study, rats were administered with 3, 6 and 12 mg/kg/day of cyclosporine from GD 7 to 17. An increase in post implantation loss was observed at 12 mg/kg/day; ventricular septal defect was observed at \u2265 6 mg/kg/day in fetuses. The IV NOEL for dams and fetus were 6 and 3 mg/kg/day (below the MRHD based on BSA), respectively after IV administration. In rabbits, cyclosporine was orally administered at dose levels of 10, 30, 100 or 300 mg/kg/day from GD 6 to 18. At 100 mg/kg/day and above, reduction in body weight gain of dams and at 300 mg/kg/day abortions were observed. Maternal toxicity, embryo-fetotoxicity as indicated by increased pre- and postnatal mortality, reduced fetal weight together with skeletal retardations were observed at 100 mg/kg/day and above. The NOEL for dams and fetuses was 30 mg/kg/day (1 times the MRHD based on BSA). In two published research studies, rabbits exposed to cyclosporine in utero (10 mg/kg/day subcutaneously) demonstrated reduced numbers of nephrons, renal hypertrophy, systemic hypertension and progressive renal insufficiency up to 35 weeks of age. These findings have not been demonstrated in other species and their relevance for humans is unknown. In a peri- and postnatal development study in rats, pregnant rats were orally administered with cyclosporine (5, 15 or 45 mg/kg/day) from GD 15 until end of lactation. At 45 mg/kg/day (0.5 times the MRHD based on BSA), increased pre and postnatal mortality of offspring and reduced body weight gain of surviving pups were observed. Cyclosporine up to 15 mg/kg/day (0.2 times the MRHD based on BSA) had no effect on pregnancy, pre and postnatal development of offspring. Nursing Mothers Cyclosporine and its metabolites are present in human milk following oral and intravenous administration. Adverse effects on the breastfed infant have not been reported. There are no data on the effects of the drug on milk production. The alcohol content of cyclosporine should be taken into account when given to lactating women (see WARNINGS , Special Excipients) . Lactating women are encouraged to avoid additional alcohol intake during treatment. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for cyclosporine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from cyclosporine or from the underlying maternal condition. Pediatric Use Although no adequate and well-controlled studies have been conducted in children, patients as young as 6 months of age have received the drug with no unusual adverse effects. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of cyclosporine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

        "Information for Patients Patients should be advised that any change of cyclosporine formulation should be made cautiously and only under physician supervision because it may result in the need for a change in dosage. Patients should be informed of the necessity of repeated laboratory tests while they are receiving the drug. They should be given careful dosage instructions, advised of the potential risks during pregnancy, and informed of the increased risk of neoplasia. Cyclosporine may impact the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised to exercise care when driving or using machines if they experience neurological disturbances including confusion, somnolence, or dizziness and discuss with their healthcare provider (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS )."

      "drug_interactions": [
        "Drug Interactions A. Effect of Drugs and Other Agents on Cyclosporine Pharmacokinetics and/or Safety All of the individual drugs cited below are well substantiated to interact with cyclosporine. In addition, concomitant use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with cyclosporine, particularly in the setting of dehydration, may potentiate renal dysfunction. Caution should be exercised when using other drugs which are known to impair renal function (see WARNINGS , Nephrotoxicity ) . Drugs That May Potentiate Renal Dysfunction Antibiotics Antineoplastics Antifungals Anti-Inflammatory Drugs Gastrointestinal Agents Immunosuppressives Other Drugs ciprofloxacin melphalan amphotericin B azapropazon cimetidine tacrolimus fibric acid derivatives (e.g., bezafibrate, fenofibrate) gentamicin ketoconazole colchicine ranitidine methotrexate tobramycin diclofenac trimethoprim with sulfamethoxazole naproxen vancomycin sulindac During the concomitant use of a drug that may exhibit additive or synergistic renal impairment potential with cyclosporine, close monitoring of renal function (in particular serum creatinine) should be performed. If a significant impairment of renal function occurs, reduction in the dosage of cyclosporine and/or coadministered drug or an alternative treatment should be considered. Cyclosporine is extensively metabolized by CYP 3A isoenzymes, in particular CYP3A4, and is a substrate of the multidrug efflux transporter P-glycoprotein. Various agents are known to either increase or decrease plasma or whole blood concentrations of cyclosporine usually by inhibition or induction of CYP3A4 or P-glycoprotein transporter or both. Compounds that decrease cyclosporine absorption, such as orlistat, should be avoided. Appropriate cyclosporine dosage adjustment to achieve the desired cyclosporine concentrations is essential when drugs that significantly alter cyclosporine concentrations are used concomitantly (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , Blood Concentration Monitoring ). 1. Drugs That Increase Cyclosporine Concentrations Calcium Channel Blockers Antifungals Antibiotics Glucocorticoids Other Drugs diltiazem fluconazole azithromycin methylprednisolone allopurinol nicardipine itraconazole clarithromycin amiodarone verapamil ketoconazole erythromycin bromocriptine voriconazole quinupristin/ colchicine dalfopristin danazol imatinib metoclopramide nefazodone oral contraceptives HIV Protease inhibitors The HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir) are known to inhibit cytochrome P-450 3A and thus could potentially increase the concentrations of cyclosporine, however, no formal studies of the interaction are available. Care should be exercised when these drugs are administered concomitantly. Grapefruit juice Grapefruit and grapefruit juice affect metabolism, increasing blood concentrations of cyclosporine, thus should be avoided. 2. Drugs/Dietary Supplements That Decrease Cyclosporine Concentrations Antibiotics Anticonvulsants Other Drugs/Dietary Supplements nafcillin carbamazepine bosentan rifampin oxcarbazepine octreotide phenobarbital orlistat phenytoin sulfinpyrazone terbinafine ticlopidine St. John's Wort Bosentan Co-administration of bosentan (250 to 1000 mg every 12 hours based on tolerability) and cyclosporine (300 mg every 12 hours for 2 days then dosing to achieve a C min of 200 to 250 ng/mL) for 7 days in healthy subjects resulted in decreases in the cyclosporine mean dose-normalized AUC, C max , and trough concentration of approximately 50%, 30% and 60%, respectively, compared to when cyclosporine was given alone (see also Effect of Cyclosporine on the Pharmacokinetics and/or Safety of Other Drugs or Agents) . Coadministration of cyclosporine with bosentan should be avoided. Boceprevir Coadministration of boceprevir (800 mg three times daily for 7 days) and cyclosporine (100 mg single dose) in healthy subjects resulted in increases in the mean AUC and C max of cyclosporine approximately 2.7-fold and 2-fold, respectively, compared to when cyclosporine was given alone. Telaprevir Coadministration of telaprevir (750 mg every 8 hours for 11 days) with cyclosporine (10 mg on Day 8) in healthy subjects resulted in increases in the mean dose-normalized AUC and C max of cyclosporine approximately 4.5-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively, compared to when cyclosporine (100 mg single dose) was given alone. St. John\u2019s Wort There have been reports of a serious drug interaction between cyclosporine and the herbal dietary supplement, St. John\u2019s Wort. This interaction has been reported to produce a marked reduction in the blood concentrations of cyclosporine, resulting in subtherapeutic levels, rejection of transplanted organs, and graft loss. Rifabutin Rifabutin is known to increase the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P-450 system. The interaction between rifabutin and cyclosporine has not been studied. Care should be exercised when these two drugs are administered concomitantly. B. Effect of Cyclosporine on the Pharmacokinetics and/or Safety of Other Drugs or Agents Cyclosporine is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and of multiple drug efflux transporters (e.g., P-glycoprotein) and may increase plasma concentrations of comedications that are substrates of CYP3A4, P-glycoprotein, or organic anion transporter proteins. Cyclosporine may reduce the clearance of digoxin, colchicine, prednisolone, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and aliskiren, bosentan, dabigatran, repaglinide, NSAIDs, sirolimus, etoposide, and other drugs. See the full prescribing information of the other drug for further information and specific recommendations. The decision on coadministration of cyclosporine with other drugs or agents should be made by the healthcare provider following the careful assessment of benefits and risks. Digoxin Severe digitalis toxicity has been seen within days of starting cyclosporine in several patients taking digoxin. If digoxin is used concurrently with cyclosporine, serum digoxin concentrations should be monitored. Colchicine There are reports on the potential of cyclosporine to enhance the toxic effects of colchicine, such as myopathy and neuropathy, especially in patients with renal dysfunction. Concomitant administration of cyclosporine and colchicine results in significant increases in colchicine plasma concentrations. If colchicine is used concurrently with cyclosporine, a reduction in the dosage of colchicine is recommended. HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors (statins) Literature and postmarketing cases of myotoxicity, including muscle pain and weakness, myositis, and rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with concomitant administration of cyclosporine with lovastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin, and rarely, fluvastatin. When concurrently administered with cyclosporine, the dosage of these statins should be reduced according to label recommendations. Statin therapy needs to be temporarily withheld or discontinued in patients with signs and symptoms of myopathy or those with risk factors predisposing to severe renal injury, including renal failure, secondary to rhabdomyolysis. Repaglinide Cyclosporine may increase the plasma concentrations of repaglinide and thereby increase the risk of hypoglycemia. In 12 healthy male subjects who received two doses of 100 mg cyclosporine capsule orally 12 hours apart with a single dose of 0.25 mg repaglinide tablet (one half of a 0.5 mg tablet) orally 13 hours after the cyclosporine initial dose, the repaglinide mean C max and AUC were increased 1.8-fold (range, 0.6 to 3.7-fold) and 2.4 fold (range, 1.2 to 5.3 fold), respectively. Close monitoring of blood glucose level is advisable for a patient taking cyclosporine and repaglinide concomitantly. Ambrisentan Coadministration of ambrisentan (5 mg daily) and cyclosporine (100 to 150 mg twice daily initially, then dosing to achieve C min 150 to 200 ng/mL) for 8 days in healthy subjects resulted mean increases in ambrisentan AUC and C max of approximately 2-fold and 1.5-fold, respectively, compared to ambrisentan alone. When coadministering ambrisentan with cyclosporine, the ambrisentan dose should not be titrated to the recommended maximum daily dose. Anthracycline antibiotics High doses of cyclosporine (e.g., at starting intravenous dose of 16 mg/kg/day) may increase the exposure to anthracycline antibiotics (e.g., doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, daunorubicin) in cancer patients. Aliskiren Cyclosporine alters the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren, a substrate of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4. In 14 healthy subjects who received concomitantly single doses of cyclosporine (200 mg) and reduced dose aliskiren (75 mg), the mean C max of aliskiren was increased by approximately 2.5-fold (90% CI: 1.96 to 3.17) and the mean AUC by approximately 4.3-fold (90% CI: 3.52 to 5.21), compared to when these subjects received aliskiren alone. The concomitant administration of aliskiren with cyclosporine prolonged the median aliskiren elimination half-life (26 hours versus 43 to 45 hours) and the T max (0.5 hours versus 1.5 to 2.0 hours). The mean AUC and C max of cyclosporine were comparable to reported literature values. Coadministration of cyclosporine and aliskiren in these subjects also resulted in an increase in the number and/or intensity of adverse events, mainly headache, hot flush, nausea, vomiting, and somnolence. The coadministration of cyclosporine with aliskiren is not recommended. Bosentan In healthy subjects, coadministration of bosentan and cyclosporine resulted in time-dependent mean increases in dose-normalized bosentan trough concentrations (i.e., approximately 21-fold on Day 1 and 2-fold on Day 8 (steady state)) compared to when bosentan was given alone as a single dose on Day 1 (see also Effect of Drugs and Other Agents on Cyclosporine Pharmacokinetics and/or Safety) . Coadministration of cyclosporine with bosentan should be avoided. Dabigatran The effect of cyclosporine on dabigatran concentrations had not been formally studied. Concomitant administration of dabigatran and cyclosporine may result in increased plasma dabigatran concentrations due to the P-gp inhibitory activity of cyclosporine. Coadministration of cyclosporine with dabigatran should be avoided. Potassium sparing diuretics Cyclosporine should not be used with potassium-sparing diuretics because hyperkalemia can occur. Caution is also required when cyclosporine is coadministered with potassium-sparing drugs (e.g., angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists), potassium-containing drugs as well as in patients on a potassium-rich diet. Control of potassium levels in these situations is advisable. Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug (NSAID) Interactions Clinical status and serum creatinine should be closely monitored when cyclosporine is used with NSAIDs in rheumatoid arthritis patients (see WARNINGS ) . Pharmacodynamic interactions have been reported to occur between cyclosporine and both naproxen and sulindac, in that concomitant use is associated with additive decreases in renal function, as determined by 99m Tc-diethylenetriaminepenta acetic acid (DTPA) and ( p -aminohippuric acid) PAH clearances. Although concomitant administration of diclofenac does not affect blood concentrations of cyclosporine, it has been associated with approximate doubling of diclofenac blood levels and occasional reports of reversible decreases in renal function. Consequently, the dose of diclofenac should be in the lower end of the therapeutic range. Methotrexate Interaction Preliminary data indicate that when methotrexate and cyclosporine were coadministered to rheumatoid arthritis patients (N = 20), methotrexate concentrations (AUCs) were increased approximately 30% and the concentrations (AUCs) of its metabolite, 7-hydroxy methotrexate, were decreased by approximately 80%. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. Cyclosporine concentrations do not appear to have been altered (N = 6). Sirolimus Elevations in serum creatinine were observed in studies using sirolimus in combination with full-dose cyclosporine. This effect is often reversible with cyclosporine dose reduction. Simultaneous coadministration of cyclosporine significantly increases blood levels of sirolimus. To minimize increases in sirolimus blood concentrations, it is recommended that sirolimus be given 4 hours after cyclosporine administration. Nifedipine Frequent gingival hyperplasia when nifedipine is given concurrently with cyclosporine has been reported. The concomitant use of nifedipine should be avoided in patients in whom gingival hyperplasia develops as a side effect of cyclosporine. Methylprednisolone Convulsions when high dose methylprednisolone is given concomitantly with cyclosporine have been reported. Other Immunosuppressive Drugs and Agents Psoriasis patients receiving other immunosuppressive agents or radiation therapy (including PUVA and UVB) should not receive concurrent cyclosporine because of the possibility of excessive immunosuppression. Interactions resulting in decrease of other drug levels Cyclosporine inhibits the enterohepatic circulation of mycophenolic acid (MPA). Concomitant administration of cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil or mycophenolate sodium in transplant patients may decrease the mean exposure of MPA by 20 \u2013 50% when compared with other immunosuppressants, which could reduce efficacy of mycophenolate mofetil or mycophenolate sodium. Monitor patients for alterations in efficacy of mycophenolate mofetil or mycophenolate sodium, when they are co-administered with cyclosporine. C. Effect of Cyclosporine on the Efficacy of Live Vaccines During treatment with cyclosporine, vaccination may be less effective. The use of live vaccines should be avoided.

        "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility Cyclosporine gave no evidence of mutagenic or teratogenic effects in appropriate test systems. Only at dose levels toxic to dams, were adverse effects seen in reproduction studies in rats (see P regnancy ) . Carcinogenicity studies were carried out in male and female rats and mice. In the 78-week mouse study, at doses of 1, 4, and 16 mg/kg/day, evidence of a statistically significant trend was found for lymphocytic lymphomas in females, and the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas in mid-dose (0.03 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area (BSA)) males significantly exceeded the control value. In the 24-month rat study, conducted at 0.5, 2, and 8 mg/kg/day, pancreatic islet cell adenomas significantly exceeded the control rate in the low-dose level (0.006 times the MRHD based on BSA). The hepatocellular carcinomas and pancreatic islet cell adenomas were not dose related. Cyclosporine has not been found mutagenic/genotoxic in the Ames test, the V79-HGPRT Test, the micronucleus test in mice and Chinese hamsters, the chromosome-aberration tests in Chinese hamster bone marrow, the mouse dominant lethal assay, and the DNA-repair test in sperm from treated mice. A recent study analyzing sister chromatid exchange (SCE) induction by cyclosporine using human lymphocytes in vitro gave indication of a positive effect (i.e., induction of SCE), at high concentrations in this system. In a fertility study in rats, increased perinatal mortality and impaired postnatal development of F1 pups were observed at 15 mg/kg/day (0.2 times the MRHD based on BSA). No adverse effects on fertility and reproduction were observed up to 5 mg/kg/day (0.06 times the MRHD based on BSA) in male and female rats. An increased incidence of malignancy is a recognized complication of immunosuppression in recipients of organ transplants. The most common forms of neoplasms are non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and carcinomas of the skin. The risk of malignancies in cyclosporine recipients is higher than in the normal, healthy population, but similar to that in patients receiving other immunosuppressive therapies. It has been reported that reduction or discontinuance of immunosuppression may cause the lesions to regress."

      "pregnancy": [
        "Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to cyclosporine, including cyclosporine MODIFIED, during pregnancy. Encourage women who are taking cyclosporine MODIFIED during pregnancy to enroll in the Transplant Pregnancy Registry International (TPRI) by calling 1-877-955-8677 or visiting https://www.transplantpregnancyregistry.org . Risk Summary Available data from published literature, including the Transplant Pregnancy Registry International, observational cohort studies, case-controlled studies, meta-analysis, case series, and case reports, over decades of use with cyclosporine in pregnancy have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, or miscarriage. Adverse maternal or fetal outcomes including hypertension, preeclampsia, preterm birth, and low birth weight are increased in patients treated with cyclosporine. However, patients receiving cyclosporine during pregnancy have underlying medical conditions and may be treated with concomitant medications that limit the interpretability of these findings (see Data) . Embryo-fetal developmental (EFD) studies in rats and rabbits with cyclosporine have shown embryo-fetal toxicity at dose levels below the MRHD based on BSA. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Available data from the National Transplantation Pregnancy Registry (NTPR) including 622 pregnancies in renal, liver, and heart transplant recipients exposed to cyclosporine during pregnancy found that the overall rate of major birth defects, live birth rates, and miscarriage rates were comparable to the general population. Maternal and fetal adverse outcomes, including the rate of hypertension, preeclampsia, premature births, and low birth weight infants appear to be increased in transplant recipients treated with cyclosporine compared to the general population. However, these patients have underlying medical conditions that confound the above findings. Animal Data Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity in rats and rabbits. Three EFD studies (two oral and one intravenous) are available in rats. In two EFD studies, pregnant rats were orally administered with cyclosporine either at doses of 10, 17, 30, 100 and 300 mg/kg/day or 4, 10 and 25 mg/kg/day from gestation day (GD) 6 to 15 or from GD 7 to 17, respectively. Maternal toxicity characterized by mortality, clinical signs of toxicity and impaired body weight gain were observed at 30 mg/kg/day and above. Cyclosporine was embryo- and fetotoxic as indicated by increased embryonic mortality and reduced fetal weight together with skeletal retardations in rats at 25 mg/kg/day and above. In addition, ventricular septal defect was observed at 25 mg/kg/day in fetuses. In the first study, the oral no observed effect level (NOEL) for both dams and fetuses was 17 mg/kg/day (0.2 times the MRHD based on BSA). In the other oral study, the NOEL for dams and fetuses were 10 and 4 mg/kg/day (0.13 and 0.05 times the MRHD based on BSA), respectively. In the IV EFD study, rats were administered with 3, 6 and 12 mg/kg/day of cyclosporine from GD 7 to 17. An increase in post implantation loss was observed at 12 mg/kg/day; ventricular septal defect was observed at \u2265 6 mg/kg/day in fetuses. The IV NOEL for dams and fetus were 6 and 3 mg/kg/day (below the MRHD based on BSA), respectively after IV administration. In rabbits, cyclosporine was orally administered at dose levels of 10, 30, 100 or 300 mg/kg/day from GD 6 to 18. At 100 mg/kg/day and above, reduction in body weight gain of dams and at 300 mg/kg/day abortions were observed. Maternal toxicity, embryo-fetotoxicity as indicated by increased pre- and postnatal mortality, reduced fetal weight together with skeletal retardations were observed at 100 mg/kg/day and above. The NOEL for dams and fetuses was 30 mg/kg/day (1 times the MRHD based on BSA). In two published research studies, rabbits exposed to cyclosporine in utero (10 mg/kg/day subcutaneously) demonstrated reduced numbers of nephrons, renal hypertrophy, systemic hypertension and progressive renal insufficiency up to 35 weeks of age. These findings have not been demonstrated in other species and their relevance for humans is unknown. In a peri- and postnatal development study in rats, pregnant rats were orally administered with cyclosporine (5, 15 or 45 mg/kg/day) from GD 15 until end of lactation. At 45 mg/kg/day (0.5 times the MRHD based on BSA), increased pre and postnatal mortality of offspring and reduced body weight gain of surviving pups were observed. Cyclosporine up to 15 mg/kg/day (0.2 times the MRHD based on BSA) had no effect on pregnancy, pre and postnatal development of offspring."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The principal adverse reactions of cyclosporine therapy are renal dysfunction, tremor, hirsutism, hypertension, and gum hyperplasia. Hypertension Hypertension, which is usually mild to moderate, may occur in approximately 50% of patients following renal transplantation and in most cardiac transplant patients. Glomerular Capillary Thrombosis Glomerular capillary thrombosis has been found in patients treated with cyclosporine and may progress to graft failure. The pathologic changes resemble those seen in the hemolytic-uremic syndrome and include thrombosis of the renal microvasculature, with platelet-fibrin thrombi occluding glomerular capillaries and afferent arterioles, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and decreased renal function. Similar findings have been observed when other immunosuppressives have been employed post transplantation. Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia has been reported in some, but not all, patients exhibiting convulsions while on cyclosporine therapy. Although magnesium-depletion studies in normal subjects suggest that hypomagnesemia is associated with neurologic disorders, multiple factors, including hypertension, high-dose methylprednisolone, hypocholesterolemia, and nephrotoxicity associated with high plasma concentrations of cyclosporine appear to be related to the neurological manifestations of cyclosporine toxicity.

        "OVERDOSAGE There is a minimal experience with overdosage. Transient hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity may occur which should resolve following drug withdrawal. Oral doses of cyclosporine up to 10 g (about 150 mg/kg) have been tolerated with relatively minor clinical consequences, such as vomiting, drowsiness, headache, tachycardia, and in a few patients, moderately severe, reversible impairment of renal function. However, serious symptoms of intoxication have been reported following accidental parenteral overdosage with cyclosporine in premature neonates. General supportive measures and symptomatic treatment should be followed in all cases of overdosage. Cyclosporine is not dialyzable to any great extent, nor is it cleared well by charcoal hemoperfusion. The oral LD 50 is 2329 mg/kg in mice, 1480 mg/kg in rats, and > 1000 mg/kg in rabbits. The intravenous (IV) LD 50 is 148 mg/kg in mice, 104 mg/kg in rats, and 46 mg/kg in rabbits."

        "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Specific Populations Renal Impairment Cyclosporine undergoes minimal renal elimination and its pharmacokinetics do not appear to be significantly altered in patients with end-stage renal disease who receive routine hemodialysis treatments (see C LINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ) . However, due to its nephrotoxic potential ( see WARNINGS ), careful monitoring of renal function is recommended; cyclosporine dosage should be reduced if indicated (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ) . Hepatic Impairment The clearance of cyclosporine may be significantly reduced in severe liver disease patients (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ) . Dose reduction may be necessary in patients with severe liver impairment to maintain blood concentrations within the recommended target range (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ) . Pediatrics In pediatric usage, the same dose and dosing regimen may be used as in adults although in several studies, children have required and tolerated higher doses than those used in adults. Adjunct therapy with adrenal corticosteroids is recommended. Different tapering dosage schedules of prednisone appear to achieve similar results. A dosage schedule based on the patient\u2019s weight started with 2.0 mg/kg/day for the first 4 days tapered to 1.0 mg/kg/day by 1 week, 0.6 mg/kg/day by 2 weeks, 0.3 mg/kg/day by 1 month, and 0.15 mg/kg/day by 2 months and thereafter as a maintenance dose. Another center started with an initial dose of 200 mg tapered by 40 mg/day until reaching 20 mg/day. After 2 months at this dose, a further reduction to 10 mg/day was made. Adjustments in dosage of prednisone must be made according to the clinical situation. Cyclosporine Injection, USP FOR INFUSION ONLY Note: Anaphylactic reactions have occurred with cyclosporine injection. See WARNINGS . Patients unable to take cyclosporine soft gelatin capsules or oral solution pre- or postoperatively may be treated with the intravenous (IV) concentrate. Cyclosporine injection, USP is administered at 1/3 the oral dose. The initial dose of cyclosporine injection, USP should be given 4 to 12 hours prior to transplantation as a single intravenous dose of 5 to 6 mg/kg/day. This daily single dose is continued postoperatively until the patient can tolerate the soft gelatin capsules or oral solution. Patients should be switched to cyclosporine soft gelatin capsules or oral solution as soon as possible after surgery. In pediatric usage, the same dose and dosing regimen may be used, although higher doses may be required. Adjunct steroid therapy is to be used (See aforementioned). Immediately before use, the intravenous concentrate should be diluted 1 mL cyclosporine injection in 20 mL to 100 mL 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection and given in a slow intravenous infusion over approximately 2 to 6 hours. Diluted infusion solutions should be discarded after 24 hours. The Cremophor \u00ae EL (polyoxyethylated castor oil) contained in the concentrate for intravenous infusion can cause phthalate stripping from PVC. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Blood Concentration Monitoring Several study centers have found blood concentration monitoring of cyclosporine useful in patient management. While no fixed relationships have yet been established, in one series of 375 consecutive cadaveric renal transplant recipients, dosage was adjusted to achieve specific whole blood 24-hour trough concentrations of 100 to 200 ng/mL as determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Of major importance to blood concentration analysis is the type of assay used. The above concentrations are specific to the parent cyclosporine molecule and correlate directly to the new monoclonal specific radioimmunoassays (mRIA-sp). Nonspecific assays are also available which detect the parent compound molecule and various of its metabolites. Older studies often cited concentrations using a nonspecific assay which were roughly twice those of specific assays. Assay results are not interchangeable and their use should be guided by their approved labeling. If plasma specimens are employed, concentrations will vary with the temperature at the time of separation from whole blood. Plasma concentrations may range from 1/2 to 1/5 of whole blood concentrations. Refer to individual assay labeling for complete instructions. In addition, Transplantation Proceedings (June 1990) contains position papers and a broad consensus generated at the Cyclosporine-Therapeutic Drug Monitoring conference that year. Blood concentration monitoring is not a replacement for renal function monitoring or tissue biopsies."

        "Drug Interactions Food Isoniazid should not be administered with food. Studies have shown that the bioavailability of isoniazid is reduced significantly when administered with food. Acetaminophen A report of severe acetaminophen toxicity was reported in a patient receiving isoniazid. It is believed that the toxicity may have resulted from a previously unrecognized interaction between isoniazid and acetaminophen and a molecular basis for this interaction has been proposed. However, current evidence suggests that isoniazid does induce P-450IIE1, a mixed-function oxidase enzyme that appears to generate the toxic metabolites, in the liver. Furthermore it has been proposed that isoniazid resulted in induction of P-450IIE1 in the patients liver which, in turn, resulted in a greater proportion of the ingested acetaminophen being converted to the toxic metabolites. Studies have demonstrated that pretreatment with isoniazid potentiates acetaminophen heaptoxicity in rats 1,2 . Carbamazepine Isoniazid is known to slow the metabolism of carbamazepine and increase its serum levels. Carbamazepine levels should be determined prior to concurrent administration with isonia- zid, signs and symptoms of carbamazepine toxicity should be monitored closely, and ap- propriate dosage adjustment of the anticonvulsant should be made 3 . Ketoconazole Potential interaction of ketoconazole and isoniazid may exist. When ketoconazole is given in combination with isoniazid and rifampin the AUC of ketoconazole is decreased by as much as 88% after 5 months of concurrent isoniazid and rifampin therapy 4 . Phenytoin Isoniazid may increase serum levels of phenytoin. To avoid phenytoin intoxication, appropriate adjustment of the anticonvulsant should be made 5,6 . Theophylline A recent study has shown that concomitant administration of isoniazid and theophylline may cause elevated plasma levels of theophylline, and in some instances a slight decrease in the elimination of isoniazid. Since the therapeutic range of theophylline is narrow, theophylline serum levels should be monitored closely, and appropriate dosage adjustments of theophylline should be made 7 . Valproate A recent case study has shown a possible increase in the plasma level of valproate when co-administered with isoniazid. Plasma valproate concentration should be monitored when isonia- zid and valproate are co-administered, and appropriate dosage adjustments of valproate should be made 5 ."

        "PRECAUTIONS General All drugs should be stopped and an evaluation made at the first sign of a hypersensitivity reaction. If isoniazid therapy must be reinstituted, the drug should be given only after symp- toms have cleared. The drug should be restarted in very small and gradually increasing doses and should be withdrawn immediately if there is any indication of recurrent hypersensitivity reaction. Use of isoniazid should be carefully monitored in the following: Daily users of alcohol. Daily ingestion of alcohol may be associated with a higher incidence of + isoniazid hepatitis. Patients with active chronic liver disease or severe renal dysfunction. Age > 35. Concurrent use of any chronically administered medication. History of previous discontinuation of isoniazid. Existence of peripheral neuropathy or conditions predisposing to neuropathy. Pregnancy. Injection drug use. Women belonging to minority groups, particularly in the post-partum period. HIV seropositive patients. Laboratory Tests Because there is a higher frequency of isoniazid associated hepatitis among certain patient groups, including Age > 35, daily users of alcohol, chronic liver disease, injection drug use and women belonging to minority groups, particularly in the post-partum period, transaminase measurements should be obtained prior to starting and monthly during preventative therapy, or more frequently as needed. If any of the values exceed three to five times the upper limit of normal, isoniazid should be temporarily discontinued and consideration given to restarting therapy. Drug Interactions Food Isoniazid should not be administered with food. Studies have shown that the bioavailability of isoniazid is reduced significantly when administered with food. Acetaminophen A report of severe acetaminophen toxicity was reported in a patient receiving isoniazid.

Carbamazepine levels should be determined prior to concurrent administration with isonia- zid, signs and symptoms of carbamazepine toxicity should be monitored closely, and ap- propriate dosage adjustment of the anticonvulsant should be made 3 . Ketoconazole Potential interaction of ketoconazole and isoniazid may exist. When ketoconazole is given in combination with isoniazid and rifampin the AUC of ketoconazole is decreased by as much as 88% after 5 months of concurrent isoniazid and rifampin therapy 4 . Phenytoin Isoniazid may increase serum levels of phenytoin. To avoid phenytoin intoxication, appropriate adjustment of the anticonvulsant should be made 5,6 . Theophylline A recent study has shown that concomitant administration of isoniazid and theophylline may cause elevated plasma levels of theophylline, and in some instances a slight decrease in the elimination of isoniazid. Since the therapeutic range of theophylline is narrow, theophylline serum levels should be monitored closely, and appropriate dosage adjustments of theophylline should be made 7 . Valproate A recent case study has shown a possible increase in the plasma level of valproate when co-administered with isoniazid. Plasma valproate concentration should be monitored when isonia- zid and valproate are co-administered, and appropriate dosage adjustments of valproate should be made 5 . Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis Isoniazid has been shown to induce pulmonary tumors in a number of strains of mice. Isoniazid has not been shown to be carcinogenic in humans. (Note: a diagnosis of mesothelioma in a child with prenatal exposure to isoniazid and no other apparent risk factors has been reported). Iso- niazid has been found to be weakly mutagenic in strains TA 100 and TA 1535 of Salmonella typhimurim (Ames assay) without metabolic activation. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C Isoniazid has been shown to have an embryocidal effect in rats and rabbits when given orally during pregnancy. Isoniazid was not teratogenic in reproduction studies in mice, rats and rabbits. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Isoniazid should be used as a treatment for active tuberculosis during pregnancy because the benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. The benefit of preventative therapy also should be weighed against a possible risk to the fetus. Preventive therapy generally should be started after delivery to prevent putting the fetus at risk of exposure; the low levels of isoniazid in breast milk do not threaten the neonate. Since isoniazid is known to cross the placenta barrier, neonates of isoniazid treated mothers should be carefully observed for any evidence of adverse effects. Nonteratogenic Effects Since isoniazid is known to cross the placenta barrier, neonates of isoniazid-treated mothers should be carefully observed for any evidence of adverse effects. Nursing Mothers The small concentrations of isoniazid in breast milk do not produce toxicity in the nursing newborn; therefore, breast-feeding should not be discouraged. However, because levels of isoniazid are so low in breast milk, they can not be relied upon for prophylaxis or therapy of nursing infants."

      "general_precautions": [
        "General All drugs should be stopped and an evaluation made at the first sign of a hypersensitivity reaction. If isoniazid therapy must be reinstituted, the drug should be given only after symp- toms have cleared. The drug should be restarted in very small and gradually increasing doses and should be withdrawn immediately if there is any indication of recurrent hypersensitivity reaction. Use of isoniazid should be carefully monitored in the following: Daily users of alcohol. Daily ingestion of alcohol may be associated with a higher incidence of + isoniazid hepatitis. Patients with active chronic liver disease or severe renal dysfunction. Age > 35. Concurrent use of any chronically administered medication. History of previous discontinuation of isoniazid. Existence of peripheral neuropathy or conditions predisposing to neuropathy. Pregnancy. Injection drug use. Women belonging to minority groups, particularly in the post-partum period. HIV seropositive patients."

      "mechanism_of_action": [
        "Mechanism of Action Isoniazid inhibits the synthesis of mycoloic acids, an essential component of the bacteri- al cell wall. At therapeutic levels isoniazid is bacteriocidal against actively growing intra- cellular and extracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis organisms. Isoniazid resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli develop rapidly when isoniazid monotherapy is administered."

      "indications_and_usage": [
        "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Isoniazid is recommended for all forms of tuberculos in which organisms are susceptible. However, active tuberculosis must be treated with multiple concomitant antituberculosis medications to prevent the emergence of drug resistance. Single-drug treatment of active tuberculos with isoniazid, or any other medication, is inadequate therapy. Isoniazid is recommended as preventive therapy for the following groups, regardless of age. (Note: the criterion for a positive reaction to a skin test (in millimeters of induration) for each group is given in parenthesis): 1. Persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (\u2265 5 mm) and persons with risk factors for HIV infection whose HIV infection status is unknown but who are suspected of having HIV infection. Preventive therapy may be considered for HIV infected persons who are tuberculin- negative but belong to groups in which the prevalence of tuberculosis infection is high. Candidates for preventive therapy who have HIV infection should have a minimum of 12 months of therapy. 2. Close contacts of persons with newly diagnosed infectious tuberculosis (\u2265 5 mm). In addition, tuberculin-negative (< 5mm) children and adolescents who have been close contacts of in- fectious persons within the past 3 months are candidates for preventive therapy until a repeat tuberculin skin test is done 12 weeks after contact with the infectious source. If the repeat skin test is positive (> 5 mm), therapy should be continued. 3. Recent converters, as indicated by a tuberculin skin test (\u2265 10 mm increase within a 2-year period for those < 35 years old; \u2265 15 mm increase for those \u2265 35 years of age). All infants and children younger than 4 years of age with a > 10 mm skin test are included in this category. 4. Persons with abnormal chest radiographs that show fibrotic lesions likely to represent old healed tuberculosis (\u2265 5 mm). Candidates for preventive therapy who have fibrotic pulmonary lesions consistent with healed tuberculosis or who have pulmonary silicosis should have 12 months of isoniazid or 4 months of isoniazid and rifampin, concomitantly. 5. Intravenous drug users known to be HIV-seronegative (> 10 mm). 6. Persons with the following medical conditions that have been reported to increase the risk of tuberculosis (\u2265 10 mm): silicosis; diabetes mellitus; prolonged therapy with adrenocorti- costeroids; immunosuppressive therapy; some hematologic and reticuloendothelial diseases, such as leukemia or Hodgkin\u2019s disease; end-stage renal disease; clinical situations associated with substantial rapid weight loss or chronic under nutrition (including: intestinal bypass surgery for obesity, the postgastrectomy state (with or without weight loss), chronic peptic ulcer disease, chronic malabsorption syndromes, and carcinomas of the oropharynx and upper gastrointestinal tract that prevent adequate nutritional intake). Candidates for preventive therapy who have fibrotic pulmonary lesions consistent with healed tuberculosis or who have pulmonary silicosis should have 12 months of isoniazid or 4 months of isoniazid and rifampin, concomitantly. Additionally, in the absence of any of the above risk factors, persons under the age of 35 with a tuberculin skin test reaction of 10 mm or more are also appropriate candidates for preventive therapy if they are a member of any of the following high-incidence groups: Foreign-born persons from high-prevalence countries who never received BCG vaccine. Medically under served low-income populations, including high-risk racial or ethnic minority populations, especially blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans. Residents of facilities for long-term care (e.g., correctional institutions, nursing homes, and mental institutions). Children who are less than 4 years old are candidates for isoniazid preventive therapy if they have > 10 mm induration from a PPD Mantoux tuberculin skin test. Finally, persons under the age of 35 who a) have none of the above risk factors (1-6); b) belong to none of the high-incidence groups; and c) have a tuberculin skin test reaction of 15 mm or more, are appropriate candidates for preventive therapy. The risk of hepatitis must be weighed against the risk of tuberculosis in positive tuberculin reactors over the age of 35. However, the use of isoniazid is recommended for those with the additional risk factors listed above (1-6) and on an individual basis insituations where there is likelihood of serious consequences to contacts who may become infected."

The agar proportion method (CDC or NCCLS M24-P) utilizes middlebrook 7H10 medium impregnated with isoniazid at two final concentrations, 0.2 and 0.1 mcg/mL. MIC 99 values are calculated by comparing the quantity of organisms growing in the medium containing drug to the control cultures. Mycobacterial growth in the presence of drug \u2265 1% of the control indicates resistance. The radiometric broth method employs the BACTEC 460 machine to compare the growth index from untreated control cultures to cultures grown in the presence of 0.2 and 1.0 mcg/mL of isoniazid. Strict adherence to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for sample processing and data interpretation is required for this assay. Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates with an MIC 99 \u2264 0.2 mcg/mL are considered to be susceptible to isoniazid. Susceptibility test results obtained by the two different methods discussed above cannot be compared unless equivalent drug concentrations are evaluated. The clinical relevance of in vitro susceptibility for mycobacterium species other than M. tuberculos is using either the BACTEC or the proportion method has not been determined."

        "Warning Severe and sometimes fatal hepatitis associated with isoniazid therapy has been re- ported and may occur or may develop even after many months of treatment. The risk of developing hepatitis is age related. Approximate case rates by age are: less than 1 per 1,000 for persons under 20 years of age, 3 per 1,000 for persons in the 20-34 year age group, 12 per 1,000 for persons in the 35-49 year age group, 23 per 1,000 for persons in the 50-64 year age group, and 8 per 1,000 for persons over 65 years of age. The risk of hepatitis is increased with daily consumption of alcohol. Precise data to provide a fatality rate for isoniazid-related hepatitis is not available; however, in a U.S. Public Health Service Surveillance Study in- volving 13,838 persons taking isoniazid, there were 8 deaths among 174 cases of hepatitis. Therefore, patients given isoniazid should be carefully monitored and interviewed at monthly intervals. For persons 35 and older, in addition to monthly symptom reviews, hepatic enzymes (specifically, AST and ALT (formerly SGOT and SGPT, respectively)) should be measured prior to starting isoniazid therapy and periodically throughout treatment. Isoniazid-associated hepatitis usually occurs during the first three months of treatment. Usually, enzyme levels return to normal despite continuance of drug, but in some cases progressive liver dysfunction occurs. Other factors associated with an increased risk of hepatitis include daily use of alcohol, chronic liver disease and injection drug use. A recent report suggests an increased risk of fatal hepatitis associated with isoniazid among women, particularly black and Hispanic women. The risk may also be increased during the post partum period. More careful monitoring should be considered in these groups, possibly including more frequent laboratory monitoring. If abnor- malities of liver function exceed three to five times the upper limit of normal, discontin- uation of isoniazid should be strongly considered. Liver function tests are not a substitute for a clinical evaluation at monthly intervals or for the prompt assessment of signs or symptoms of adverse reactions occurring between regularly scheduled evaluations. Patients should be instructed to immediately report signs or symptoms consistent with liver damage or other adverse effects. These include any of the following: unexplained anorexia, nausea, vomiting, dark urine, icterus, rash, persistent paresthesias of the hands and feet, persistent fatigue, weakness or fever of greater than 3 days duration and/or abdominal tenderness, especially right upper quadrant discomfort. If these symptoms appear or if signs suggestive of hepatic damage are detected, isoniazid should be discontinued promptly, since continued use of the drug in these cases has been reported to cause a more severe form of liver damage. Patients with tuberculosis who have hepatitis attributed to isoniazid should be given appro- priate treatment with alternative drugs. If isoniazid must be reinstituted, it should be reinsti- tuted only after symptoms and laboratory abnormalities have cleared. The drug should be restarted in very small and gradually increasing doses and should be withdrawn immedi- ately if there is any indication of recurrent liver involvement. Preventive treatment should be deferred in persons with acute hepatic diseases."

        "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (See also INDICATIONS0.) - NOTE -- For preventive therapy of tuberculous infection and treatment of tuberculosis, it is recommended that physicians be familiar with the following publications: (1) the recommen- dations of the Advisory Council for the Elimination of Tuberculosis, published in the MMWR: vol 42; RR-4, 1993 and (2) Treatment of Tuberculosis and Tuberculosis Infection in Adults and Children, American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine: vol 149; 1359-1374, 1994. For Treatment of Tuberculosis Isoniazid is used in conjunction with other effective anti-tuberculosis agents. Drug susceptibility testing should be performed on the organisms initially isolated from all patients with newly diagnosed tuberculosis. If the bacilli becomes resistant, therapy must be changed to agents to which the bacilli are susceptible. Usual Oral Dosage (depending on the regimen used): Adults: 5 mg/kg up to 300 mg daily in a single dose; or 15 mg/kg up to 900 mg/day, two or three times/week Children: 10 - 15 mg/kg up to 300 mg daily in a single dose; or 20-40 mg/kg up to 900 mg/day, two or three times/week Patients with Pulmonary Tuberculosis Without HIV Infection There are 3 regimen options for the initial treatment of tuberculosis in children and adults: Option 1: Daily isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide for 8 weeks followed by 16 weeks of isoniazid and rifampin daily or 2 to 3 times weekly. Ethambutol or streptomycin should be added to the initial regimen until sensitivity to isoniazid and rifampin is demonstrated. The addition of a fourth drug is optional if the relative prevalence of isoniazid-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in the community is less than or equal to four percent. Option 2: Daily isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and streptomycin or ethambutol for 2 weeks followed by twice weekly administration of the same drugs for 6 weeks, subsequently twice weekly isoniazid and rifampin for 16 weeks. Option 3: Three times weekly with isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol or streptomycin for 6 months. * All regimen given twice weekly or 3 times weekly should be administered by directly observed therapy (see also Directly Observed Therapy ). The above treatment guidelines apply only when the disease is caused by organisms that are sus- ceptible to the standard antituberculous agents. Because of the impact of resistance to isoniazid and rifampin on the response to therapy, it is essential that physicians initiating therapy for tu- berculosis be familiar with the prevalence of drug resistance in their communities. It is suggested that ethambutol not be used in children whose visual acuity cannot be monitored. Patients with Pulmonary Tuberculosis and HIV Infection The response of the immunologically impaired host to treatment may not be as satisfactory as that of a person with normal host responsiveness. For this reason, therapeutic decisions for the impaired host must be individualized. Since patients co-infected with HIV may have problems with malabsorption, screening of antimycobacterial drug levels, especially in patients with ad- vanced HIV disease, may be necessary to prevent the emergence of MDRTB. Patients with Extra Pulmonary Tuberculosis The basic principles that underlie the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis also apply to Extra pulmonary forms of the disease. Although there have not been the same kinds of carefully conducted controlled trials of treatment of Extra pulmonary tuberculosis as for pulmonary disease, increasing clinical experience indicates that a 6 to 9 month short-course regimen is effective. Because of the insufficient data, military tuberculosis, bone/joint tuberculosis, and tuberculous meningitis in infants and children should receive 12 month therapy. Bacteriologic evaluation of Extra pulmonary tuberculosis may be limited by the relative in accessibility of the sites of disease. Thus, response to treatment often must be judged on the basis of clinical and radiographic findings. The use of adjunctive therapies such as surgery and corticosteroids is more commonly required in Extra pulmonary tuberculosis than in pulmonary disease. Surgery may be necessary to obtain specimens for diagnosis and to treat such processes as constrictive pericarditis and spinal cord compression from Pott\u2019s Disease. Corticosteroids have been shown to be of benefit in preventing cardiac constriction from tuberculous pericarditis and in decreasing the neurologic sequelae of all stages of tuberculosis meningitis, especially when administered early in the course of the disease. Pregnant Women with Tuberculosis The options listed above must be adjusted for the pregnant patient. Streptomycin interferes with in utero development of the ear and may cause congenital deafness. Routine use of pyrazinamide is also not recommended in pregnancy because of inadequate teratogenicity data. The initial treatment regimen should consist of isoniazid and rifampin. Ethambutol should be included unless primary isoniazid resistance is unlikely (isoniazid resistance rate documented to be less than 4%). Treatment of Patients with Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDRTB) Multiple-drug resistant tuberculosis (i.e., resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampin) presents difficult treatment problems. Treatment must be individualized and based on susceptibility studies. In such cases, consultation with an expert in tuberculosis is recommended. Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) A major cause of drug-resistant tuberculosis is patient noncompliance with treatment. The use of DOT can help assure patient compliance with drug therapy. DOT is the observation of the pa- tient by a health care provider or other responsible person as the patient ingests anti-tuberculosis medications. DOT can be achieved with daily, twice weekly or thrice weekly regimens, and is recommended for all patients. For Preventative Therapy of Tuberculosis Before isoniazid preventive therapy is initiated, bacteriologically positive or radiographically progressive tuberculosis must be excluded. Appropriate evaluations should be performed if Extra pulmonary tuberculosis is suspected. Adults over 30 Kg: 300 mg per day in a single dose. Infants and Children: 10 mg/kg (up to 300 mg daily) in a single dose. In situations where adherence with daily preventative therapy cannot be assured, 20-30 mg/kg (not to exceed 900 mg) twice weekly under the direct observation of a health care worker at the time of admin- istration 8 . Continuous administration of isoniazid for a sufficient period is an essential part of the regimen because relapse rates are higher if chemotherapy is stopped prematurely. In the treatment of tu- berculosis, resistant organisms may multiply and the emergence of resistant organisms during the treatment may necessitate a change in the regimen. For following patient compliance: the Potts-Cozart test 9 , a simple colorimetric 6 method of checking for isoniazid in the urine, is a useful tool for assuring patient compliance, which is essential for effective tuberculosis control. Additionally, isoniazid test strips are also available to check patient compliance. Concomitant administration of pyridoxine (B 6 ) is recommended in malnourished and in those predisposed to neuropathy (e.g., alcoholics and diabetics)."

      "adverse_reactions": [
        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The most frequent reactions are those affecting the nervous system and the liver. Nervous System Reactions Peripheral neuropathy is the most common toxic effect. It is dose-related, occurs most often in the malnourished and in those predisposed to neuritis (e.g., alcoholics and diabetics), and is usually preceded by paresthesias of the feet and hands. The incidence is higher in \"slow inactivators\". Other neurotoxic effects, which are uncommon with conventional doses, are convulsions, toxic encephalopathy, optic neuritis and atrophy, memory impairment, and toxic psychosis. Hepatic Reactions See boxed warning . Elevated serum transaminase (SGOT; SGPT), bilirubinemia, bilirubinuria, jaundice, and occasionally severe and sometimes fatal hepatitis. The common prodromal symp- toms of hepatitis are anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, malaise, and weakness. Mild hepatic dysfunction, evidenced by mild and transient elevation of serum transaminase levels occurs in 10 to 20 percent of patients taking isoniazid. This abnormality usually appears in the first 1 to 3 months of treatment but can occur at any time during therapy. In most instances, enzyme levels return to normal, and generally, there is no necessity to discontinue medication during the period of mild serum transaminase elevation. In occasional instances, progressive liver damage occurs, with accompanying symptoms. If the SGOT value exceeds three to five times the upper limit of normal, discontinuation of the isoniazid should be strongly considered. The frequency of progres- sive liver damage increases with age. It is rare in persons under 20, but occurs in up to 2.3 percent of those over 50 years of age. Gastrointestinal Reactions Nausea, vomiting, and epigastric distress. Hematologic Reactions Agranulocytosis; hemolytic, sideroblastic, or aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia; and eosinophilia. Hypersensitivity Reactions Fever, skin eruptions (morbilliform, maculopapular, purpuric, or exfoliative), lymphadenopathy, and vasculitis. Metabolic and Endocrine Reactions Pyridoxine deficiency, pellagra, hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and gynecomastia.

It diffuses readily into all body fluids (cerebrospinal, pleural, and ascitic fluids), tissues, organs, and excreta (saliva, sputum, and feces). The drug also passes through the placental barrier and into milk in concentrations comparable to those in the plasma. From 50 to 70 percent of a dose of isoniazid is excreted in the urine within 24 hours. Isoniazid is metabolized primarily by acetylation and dehydrazination. The rate of acetylation is genetically determined. Approximately 50 percent of Blacks and Caucasians are \"slow inacti- vators\", and the rest are \"rapid inactivators\"; the majority of Eskimos and Orientals are\" rapid inactivators.\" The rate of acetylation does not significantly alter the effectiveness of isoniazid. However, slow acetylation may lead to higher blood levels of the drug and, thus, to an increase in toxic reactions. Pyridoxine (vitamin B 6 ) deficiency is sometimes observed in adults with high doses of isoniazid and is considered probably due to its competition with pyridoxal phosphate for the enzyme apotryptophanase. Mechanism of Action Isoniazid inhibits the synthesis of mycoloic acids, an essential component of the bacteri- al cell wall. At therapeutic levels isoniazid is bacteriocidal against actively growing intra- cellular and extracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis organisms. Isoniazid resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli develop rapidly when isoniazid monotherapy is administered. Microbiology Two standardized in vitro susceptibility methods are available for testing isoniazid against Mycobacterium tuberculosis organisms. The agar proportion method (CDC or NCCLS M24-P) utilizes middlebrook 7H10 medium impregnated with isoniazid at two final concentrations, 0.2 and 0.1 mcg/mL. MIC 99 values are calculated by comparing the quantity of organisms growing in the medium containing drug to the control cultures. Mycobacterial growth in the presence of drug \u2265 1% of the control indicates resistance. The radiometric broth method employs the BACTEC 460 machine to compare the growth index from untreated control cultures to cultures grown in the presence of 0.2 and 1.0 mcg/mL of isoniazid. Strict adherence to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for sample processing and data interpretation is required for this assay. Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates with an MIC 99 \u2264 0.2 mcg/mL are considered to be susceptible to isoniazid. Susceptibility test results obtained by the two different methods discussed above cannot be compared unless equivalent drug concentrations are evaluated. The clinical relevance of in vitro susceptibility for mycobacterium species other than M. tuberculos is using either the BACTEC or the proportion method has not been determined."

      "overdosage": [
        "OVERDOSAGE Signs and Symptoms Isoniazid overdosage produces signs and symptoms within 30 minutes to 3 hours after ingestion. Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, slurring of speech, blurring of vision, and visual hallucinations (including bright colors and strange designs) are among the early manifestations. With marked overdosage, respiratory distress and CNS depression, progressing rapidly from stupor to profound coma, are to be expected, along with severe, intractable seizures. Severe metabolic acidosis, acetonuria, and hyperglycemia are typical laboratory findings. Treatment Untreated or inadequately treated cases of gross isoniazid overdosage, 80 mg/kg - 150 mg/kg, can cause neurotoxicity 6 and terminate fatally, but good response has been reported in most patients brought under adequate treatment within the first few hours after drug ingestion. For the Asymptomatic Patient Absorption of drugs from the GI tract may be decreased by giving activated charcoal. Gastric emptying should also be employed in the asymptomatic patient. Safeguard the patient\u2019s airway when employing these procedures. Patients who acutely ingest > 80 mg/kg should be treated with intravenous pyridoxine on a gram per gram basis equal to the isoniazid dose. If an unknown amount of isoniazid is ingested, consider an initial dose of 5 grams of pyridoxine given over 30 to 60 minutes in adults, or 80 mg/kg of pyridoxine in children. For the Symptomatic Patient Ensure adequate ventilation, support cardiac output, and protect the airway while treating seizures and attempting to limit absorption. If the dose of isoniazid is known, the patient should be treated initially with a slow intravenous bolus of pyridoxine, over 3 to 5 minutes, on a gram per gram basis, equal to the isoniazid dose. If the quantity of isoniazid ingestion is unknown, then consider an initial intravenous bolus of pyridoxine of 5 grams in the adult or 80 mg/kg in the child. If seizures continue, the dosage of pyridoxine may be repeated. It would be rare that more than 10 grams of pyridoxine would need to be given. The maximum safe dose for pyridoxine in isoniazid intoxication is not known. If the patient does not respond to pyridoxine, diazepam may be ad- ministered. Phenytoin should be used cautiously, because isoniazid interferes with the metabo- lism of phenytoin. General Obtain blood samples for immediate determination of gases, electrolytes, BUN, glucose, etc.; type and cross-match blood in preparation for possible hemodialysis. Rapid Control of Metabolic Acidosis Patients with this degree of INH intoxication are likely to have hypoventilation. The ad- ministration of sodium bicarbonate under these circumstances can cause exacerbation of hypercarbia. Ventilation must be monitored carefully, by measuring blood carbon dioxide levels, and supported mechanically, if there is respiratory insufficiency. Dialysis Both peritoneal and hemodialysis have been used in the management of isoniazid overdosage. These procedures are probably not required if control of seizures and acidosis is achieved with pyridoxine, diazepam and bicarbonate. Along with measures based on initial and repeated determination of blood gases and other laboratory tests as needed, utilize meticulous respiratory and other intensive care to protect against hypoxia, hypotension, aspiration, pneumonitis, etc."

      "precautions": [
        "PRECAUTIONS The lowest possible dose of corticosteroids should be used to control the condition under treatment. When reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual. Since complications of treatment with glucocorticoids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, a risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used. Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement. As sodium retention with resultant edema and potassium loss may occur in patients receiving corticosteroids, these agents should be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure, hypertension, or renal insufficiency. Drug-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for up to 12 months after discontinuation of therapy following large doses for prolonged periods; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt and/or a mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently. There is an enhanced effect of corticosteroids on patients with hypothyroidism. Steroids should be used with caution in active or latent peptic ulcers, diverticulitis, fresh intestinal anastomoses, and nonspecific ulcerative colitis, since they may increase the risk of a perforation. Signs of peritoneal irritation following gastrointestinal perforation in patients receiving corticosteroids may be minimal or absent. There is an enhanced effect due to decreased metabolism of corticosteroids in patients with cirrhosis. Corticosteroids decrease bone formation and increase bone resorption both through their effect on calcium regulation (i.e., decreasing absorption and increasing excretion) and inhibition of osteoblast function. This, together with a decrease in the protein matrix of the bone secondary to an increase in protein catabolism, and reduced sex hormone production, may lead to inhibition of bone growth in pediatric patients and the development of osteoporosis at any age. Growth and development of infants and children on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should be carefully observed. Special consideration should be given to patients at increased risk of osteoporosis (e.g., postmenopausal women) before initiating corticosteroid therapy. Inclusion of therapy for osteoporosis prevention or treatment should be considered. To minimize the risk of glucocorticoid-induced bone loss, the smallest possible effective dosage and duration should be used. Lifestyle modification to reduce the risk of osteoporosis (e.g., cigarette smoking cessation, limitation of alcohol consumption, participation in weight-bearing exercise for 30-60 minutes daily) should be encouraged. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation, bisphosphonate (e.g., alendronate, risedronate), and a weight-bearing exercise program that maintains muscle mass are suitable first-line therapies aimed at reducing the risk of adverse bone effects. Current recommendations suggest that all interventions be initiated in any patient in whom glucocorticoid therapy with at least the equivalent of 5 mg of prednisone for at least 3 months is anticipated; in addition, sex hormone replacement therapy (combined estrogen and progestin in women; testosterone in men) should be offered to such patients who are hypogonadal or in whom replacement is otherwise clinically indicated and biphosphonate therapy should be initiated (if not already) if bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine and/or hip is below normal. Although controlled clinical trials have shown corticosteroids to be effective in speeding the resolution of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, they do not show that they affect the ultimate outcome or natural history of the disease. The studies do show that relatively high doses of corticosteroids are necessary to demonstrate a significant effect. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Multiple Sclerosis .) An acute myopathy has been observed with the use of high doses of corticosteroids, most often occurring in patients with disorders of neuromuscular transmission (e.g., myasthenia gravis), or in patients receiving concomitant therapy with neuromuscular blocking drugs (e.g., pancuronium). This acute myopathy is generalized, may involve ocular and respiratory muscles, and may result in quadriparesis. Elevation of creatinine kinase may occur. Clinical improvement or recovery after stopping corticosteroids may require weeks to years. Psychiatric derangements may appear when corticosteroids are used, ranging from euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, and severe depression, to frank psychotic manifestations. Also, existing emotional instability or psychotic tendencies may be aggravated by corticosteroids. Intraocular pressure may become elevated in some individuals. If steroid therapy is continued for more than 6 weeks, intraocular pressure should be monitored. Patients should be warned not to discontinue the use of corticosteroids abruptly or without medical supervision. As prolonged use may cause adrenal insufficiency and make patients dependent on corticosteroids, they should advise any medical attendants that they are taking corticosteroids and they should seek medical advice at once should they develop an acute illness including fever or other signs of infection. Following prolonged therapy, withdrawal of corticosteroids may result in symptoms of the corticosteroid withdrawal syndrome including, myalgia, arthralgia, and malaise. Persons who are on corticosteroids should be warned to avoid exposure to chickenpox or measles. Patients should also be advised that if they are exposed, medical advice should be sought without delay. Amphotericin B Injection and Potassium-Depleting Agents When corticosteroids are administered concomitantly with potassium-depleting agents (e.g., amphotericin B, diuretics ), patients should be observed closely for development of hypokalemia. In addition, there have been cases reported in which concomitant use of amphotericin B and hydrocortisone was followed by cardiac enlargement and congestive heart failure. Antibiotics Macrolide antibiotics have been reported to cause a significant decrease in corticosteroid clearance (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions: Hepatic Enzyme Inducers, Inhibitors and Substrates). Anticholinesterases Concomitant use of anticholinesterase agents (e.g., neostigmine, pyridostigmine ) and corticosteroids may produce severe weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis. If possible, anticholinesterase agents should be withdrawn at least 24 hours before initiating corticosteroid therapy. If concomitant therapy must occur, it should take place under close supervision and the need for respiratory support should be anticipated. Anticoagulants, Oral Co-administration of corticosteroids and warfarin usually results in inhibition of response to warfarin, although there have been some conflicting reports. Therefore, coagulation indices should be monitored frequently to maintain the desired anticoagulant effect. Antidiabetics Because corticosteroids may increase blood glucose concentrations, dosage adjustments of antidiabetic agents may be required. Antitubercular Drugs Serum concentrations of isoniazid may be decreased. Bupropion Since systemic steroids, as well as bupropion, can lower the seizure threshold, concurrent administration should be undertaken only with extreme caution; low initial dosing and small gradual increases should be employed. Cholestyramine Cholestyramine may increase the clearance of corticosteroids. Cyclosporine Increased activity of both cyclosporine and corticosteroids may occur when the two are used concurrently. Convulsions have been reported with this concurrent use. Digitalis Glycosides Patients on digitalis glycosides may be at increased risk of arrhythmias due to hypokalemia. Estrogens, Including Oral Contraceptives Estrogens may decrease the hepatic metabolism of certain corticosteroids, thereby increasing their effect. Fluoroquinolones Post-marketing surveillance reports indicate that the risk of tendon rupture may be increased in patients receiving concomitant fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin ) and corticosteroids, especially in the elderly. Tendon rupture can occur during or after treatment with quinolones. Hepatic Enzyme Inducers, Inhibitors and Substrates Drugs which induce cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP 3A4) enzyme activity (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin ) may enhance the metabolism of corticosteroids and require that the dosage of the corticosteroid be increased. Drugs which inhibit CYP 3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, indinavir, macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin ) have the potential to result in increased plasma concentrations of corticosteroids. Glucocorticoids are moderate inducers of CYP 3A4. Co-administration with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP 3A4 (e.g., indinavir, erythromycin ) may increase their clearance, resulting in decreased plasma concentration. Ketoconazole Ketoconazole has been reported to decrease the metabolism of certain corticosteroids by up to 60%, leading to increased risk of corticosteroid side effects. In addition, ketoconazole alone can inhibit adrenal corticosteroid synthesis and may cause adrenal insufficiency during corticosteroid withdrawal. Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents (NSAIDS) Concomitant use of aspirin (or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents ) and corticosteroids increases the risk of gastrointestinal side effects. Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in hypoprothrombinemia. The clearance of salicylates may be increased with concurrent use of corticosteroids; this could lead to decreased salicylate serum levels or increase the risk of salicylate toxicity when corticosteroid is withdrawn. Phenytoin In post-marketing experience, there have been reports of both increases and decreases in phenytoin levels with dexamethasone co-administration, leading to alterations in seizure control. Phenytoin has been demonstrated to increase the hepatic metabolism of corticosteroids, resulting in a decreased therapeutic effect of the corticosteroid. Quetiapine Increased doses of quetiapine may be required to maintain control of symptoms of schizophrenia in patients receiving a glucocorticoid, a hepatic enzyme inducer. Skin Tests Corticosteroids may suppress reactions to skin tests. Thalidomide Co-administration with thalidomide should be employed cautiously, as toxic epidermal necrolysis has been reported with concomitant use. Vaccines Patients on corticosteroid therapy may exhibit a diminished response to toxoids and live or inactivated vaccines due to inhibition of antibody response. Corticosteroids may also potentiate the replication of some organisms contained in live attenuated vaccines. Routine administration of vaccines or toxoids should be deferred until corticosteroid therapy is discontinued if possible (See WARNINGS: Infection: Vaccination). No adequate studies have been conducted in animals to determine whether corticosteroids have a potential for carcinogenesis or mutagenesis. Steroids may increase or decrease motility and number of spermatozoa in some patients. Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in many species when given in doses equivalent to the human dose. Animal studies in which corticosteroids have been given to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits have yielded an increased incidence of cleft palate in the offspring. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Corticosteroids should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Infants born to mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy should be carefully observed for signs of hypoadrenalism. Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from corticosteroids, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. The efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in the pediatric population are based on the well-established course of effect of corticosteroids, which is similar in pediatric and adult populations. Published studies provide evidence of efficacy and safety in pediatric patients for the treatment of nephrotic syndrome (patients >2 years of age), and aggressive lymphomas and leukemias (patients >1 month of age). Other indications for pediatric use of corticosteroids, e.g., severe asthma and wheezing, are based on adequate and well-controlled trials conducted in adults, on the premises that the course of the diseases and their pathophysiology are considered to be substantially similar in both populations. The adverse effects of corticosteroids in pediatric patients are similar to those in adults (See ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Like adults, pediatric patients should be carefully observed with frequent measurements of blood pressure, weight, height, intraocular pressure, and clinical evaluation for the presence of infection, psychosocial disturbances, thromboembolism, peptic ulcers, cataracts, and osteoporosis. Pediatric patients who are treated with corticosteroids by any route, including systemically administered corticosteroids, may experience a decrease in their growth velocity. This negative impact of corticosteroids on growth has been observed at low systemic doses and in the absence of laboratory evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression (i.e., cosyntropin stimulation and basal cortisol plasma levels). Growth velocity may therefore be a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in pediatric patients than some commonly used tests of HPA axis function. The linear growth of pediatric patients treated with corticosteroids should be monitored, and the potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against clinical benefits obtained and the availability of treatment alternatives. In order to minimize the potential growth effects of corticosteroids, pediatric patients should be titrated to the lowest effective dose. Clinical studies did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. In particular, the increased risk of diabetes mellitus, fluid retention and hypertension in elderly patients treated with corticosteroids should be considered."

      "warnings": [
        "WARNINGS Rare instances of anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy (See ADVERSE REACTIONS: Allergic Reactions ). Increased dosage of rapidly acting corticosteroids is indicated in patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to any unusual stress before, during and after the stressful situation. Average and large doses of hydrocortisone or cortisone can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion. Literature reports suggest an apparent association between use of corticosteroids and left ventricular free wall rupture after a recent myocardial infarction; therefore, therapy with corticosteroids should be used with great caution in these patients. Corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for corticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment. Adrenocortical insufficiency may result from too rapid withdrawal of corticosteroids and may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for up to 12 months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. If the patient is receiving steroids already, dosage may have to be increased. Metabolic clearance of corticosteroids is decreased in hypothyroid patients and increased in hyperthyroid patients. Changes in thyroid status of the patient may necessitate adjustment in dosage. General Patients who are on corticosteroids are more susceptible to infections than are healthy individuals. There may be decreased resistance and inability to localize infection when corticosteroids are used. Infection with any pathogen (viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan or helminthic) in any location of the body may be associated with the use of corticosteroids alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive agents that affect cellular immunity, humoral immunity, or neutrophil function. 1 These infections may be mild, but may be severe and at times fatal. With increasing doses of corticosteroids, the rate of occurrence of infectious complications increases. 2 Corticosteroids may also mask some signs of current infection. Fungal Infections Corticosteroids may exacerbate systemic fungal infections and therefore should not be used in the presence of such infections unless they are needed to control life-threatening drug reactions. There have been cases reported in which concomitant use of amphotericin B and hydrocortisone was followed by cardiac enlargement and congestive heart failure (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions : Amphotericin B Injection and Potassium-Depleting Agents). Special Pathogens Latent disease may be activated or there may be an exacerbation of intercurrent infections due to pathogens, including those caused by Amoeba, Candida, Cryptococcus, Mycobacterium, Nocardia, Pneumocystis, Toxoplasma . It is recommended that latent amebiasis or active amebiasis be ruled out before initiating corticosteroid therapy in any patient who has spent time in the tropics or any patient with unexplained diarrhea. Similarly, corticosteroids should be used with great care in patients with known or suspected Strongyloides (threadworm) infestation. In such patients, corticosteroid-induced immunosuppression may lead to Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied by severe enterocolitis and potentially fatal gram-negative septicemia. Corticosteroids should not be used in cerebral malaria. Tuberculosis The use of prednisone in active tuberculosis should be restricted to those cases of fulminating or disseminated tuberculosis in which the corticosteroid is used for management of the disease in conjunction with an appropriate antituberculous regimen. If corticosteroids are indicated in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, close observation is necessary as reactivation of the disease may occur. During prolonged corticosteroid therapy, these patients should receive chemoprophylaxis. Vaccination Administration of live or live, attenuated vaccines is contraindicated in patients receiving immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids. Killed or inactivated vaccines may be administered. However, the response to such vaccines may be diminished and cannot be predicted . Indicated immunization procedures may be undertaken in patients receiving nonimmunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids as replacement therapy (e.g., for Addison\u2019s disease). Viral Infections Chickenpox and measles can have a more serious or even fatal course in pediatric and adult patients on corticosteroids. In pediatric and adult patients who have not had these diseases, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. Ophthalmic Use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to bacteria, fungi or viruses. The use of oral corticosteroids is not recommended in the treatment of optic neuritis and may lead to an increase in the risk of new episodes. Corticosteroids should not be used in active ocular herpes simplex because of possible corneal perforation."

        "DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION Gastric irritation may be reduced if taken before, during, or immediately after meals or with food or milk. The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between 2 am and 8 am, and it is minimal between 4 pm and midnight. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocorticoid activity the least when given at the time of maximal activity (am) for single dose administration. Therefore, it is recommended that prednisone be administered in the morning prior to 9 am and when large doses are given, administration of antacids between meals to help prevent peptic ulcers. Multiple dose therapy should be evenly distributed in evenly spaced intervals throughout the day. Dietary salt restriction may be advisable in patients. Do not stop taking this medicine without first talking to your doctor. Avoid abrupt withdraw of therapy. The initial dosage of prednisone may vary from 5 mg to 60 mg per day, depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice, while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, prednisone should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small increments at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient\u2019s individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment; in this latter situation, it may be necessary to increase the dosage of prednisone for a period of time consistent with the patient\u2019s condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective. (Dosage range is the same for prednisone and prednisolone.) Alternate day therapy is a corticosteroid dosing regimen in which twice the usual daily dose of corticoid is administered every other morning. The purpose of this mode of therapy is to provide the patient requiring long-term pharmacologic dose treatment with the beneficial effects of corticoids while minimizing certain undesirable effects, including pituitary-adrenal suppression, the cushingoid state, corticoid withdrawal symptoms, and growth suppression in children. The rationale for this treatment schedule is based on two major premises: (a) the anti-inflammatory or therapeutic effect of corticoids persists longer than their physical presence and metabolic effects and (b) administration of the corticosteroid every other morning allows for re-establishment of more nearly normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity on the off-steroid day. A brief review of the HPA physiology may be helpful in understanding this rationale. Acting primarily through the hypothalamus a fall in free cortisol stimulates the pituitary gland to produce increasing amounts of corticotropin (ACTH) while a rise in free cortisol inhibits ACTH secretion. Normally the HPA system is characterized by diurnal (circadian) rhythm. Serum levels of ACTH rise from a low point about 10 pm to a peak level about 6 am. Increasing levels of ACTH stimulate adrenocortical activity resulting in a rise in plasma cortisol with maximal levels occurring between 2 am and 8 am. This rise in cortisol dampens ACTH production and in turn adrenocortical activity. There is a gradual fall in plasma corticoids during the day with lowest levels occurring about midnight. The diurnal rhythm of the HPA axis is lost in Cushing\u2019s disease, a syndrome of adrenocortical hyperfunction characterized by obesity with centripetal fat distribution, thinning of the skin with easy bruisability, muscle wasting with weakness, hypertension, latent diabetes, osteoporosis, electrolyte imbalance, etc. The same clinical findings of hyperadrenocorticism may be noted during long-term pharmacologic dose corticoid therapy administered in conventional daily divided doses. It would appear, then, that a disturbance in the diurnal cycle with maintenance of elevated corticoid values during the night may play a significant role in the development of undesirable corticoid effects. Escape from these constantly elevated plasma levels for even short periods of time may be instrumental in protecting against undesirable pharmacologic effects. During conventional pharmacologic dose corticosteroid therapy, ACTH production is inhibited with subsequent suppression of cortisol production by the adrenal cortex. Recovery time for normal HPA activity is variable depending upon the dose and duration of treatment. During this time the patient is vulnerable to any stressful situation. Although it has been shown that there is considerably less adrenal suppression following a single morning dose of prednisolone (10 mg) as opposed to a quarter of that dose administered every 6 hours, there is evidence that some suppressive effect on adrenal activity may be carried over into the following day when pharmacologic doses are used. Further, it has been shown that a single dose of certain corticosteroids will produce adrenocortical suppression for two or more days. Other corticoids, including methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone, prednisone, and prednisolone, are considered to be short acting (producing adrenocortical suppression for 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 days following a single dose) and thus are recommended for alternate day therapy. The following should be kept in mind when considering alternate day therapy: 1. Basic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should apply. The benefits of alternate day therapy should not encourage the indiscriminate use of steroids. 2. Alternate day therapy is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for patients in whom long-term pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated. 3. In less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated, it may be possible to initiate treatment with alternate day therapy. More severe disease states usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initial control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should be continued until satisfactory clinical response is obtained, usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases. It is important to keep the period of initial suppressive dose as brief as possible particularly when subsequent use of alternate day therapy is intended. Once control has been established, two courses are available: (a) change to alternate day therapy and then gradually reduce the amount of corticoid given every other day or (b) following control of the disease process reduce the daily dose of corticoid to the lowest effective level as rapidly as possible and then change over to an alternate day schedule. Theoretically, course (a) may be preferable. 4. Because of the advantages of alternate day therapy, it may be desirable to try patients on this form of therapy who have been on daily corticoids for long periods of time (e.g., patients with rheumatoid arthritis). Since these patients may already have a suppressed HPA axis, establishing them on alternate day therapy may be difficult and not always successful. However, it is recommended that regular attempts be made to change them over. It may be helpful to triple or even quadruple the daily maintenance dose and administer this every other day rather than just doubling the daily dose if difficulty is encountered. Once the patient is again controlled, an attempt should be made to reduce this dose to a minimum. 5. As indicated above, certain corticosteroids, because of their prolonged suppressive effect on adrenal activity, are not recommended for alternate day therapy (e.g., dexamethasone and betamethasone). 6. The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between 2 am and 8 am, and it is minimal between 4 pm and midnight. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocortical activity the least, when given at the time of maximal activity (am). 7. In using alternate day therapy it is important, as in all therapeutic situations to individualize and tailor the therapy to each patient. Complete control of symptoms will not be possible in all patients. An explanation of the benefits of alternate day therapy will help the patient to understand and tolerate the possible flare-up in symptoms which may occur in the latter part of the off-steroid day. Other symptomatic therapy may be added or increased at this time if needed. 8. In the event of an acute flare-up of the disease process, it may be necessary to return to a full suppressive daily divided corticoid dose for control. Once control is again established alternate day therapy may be re-instituted. 9. Although many of the undesirable features of corticosteroid therapy can be minimized by alternate day therapy, as in any therapeutic situation, the physician must carefully weigh the benefit-risk ratio for each patient in whom corticoid therapy is being considered."

        "Drug Interactions Serotonergic Drugs Based on the mechanism of action of SNRIs and SSRIs including citalopram HBr, and the potential for serotonin syndrome, caution is advised when citalopram HBr is coadministered with other drugs that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems, such as triptans, linezolid (an antibiotic which is a reversible non-selective MAOI), lithium, tramadol, or St. John's Wort (see WARNINGS-Serotonin Syndrome ). The concomitant use of citalopram HBr with other SSRIs, SNRIs or tryptophan is not recommended (see PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions ). Triptans There have been rare postmarketing reports of serotonin syndrome with use of an SSRI and a triptan. If concomitant treatment of citalopram HBr with a triptan is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases (see WARNINGS - Serotonin Syndrome ). CNS Drugs Given the primary CNS effects of citalopram, caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs. Alcohol Although citalopram did not potentiate the cognitive and motor effects of alcohol in a clinical trial, as with other psychotropic medications, the use of alcohol by depressed patients taking citalopram HBr is not recommended. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS . Drugs That Interfere With Hemostasis (NSAIDs, Aspirin, Warfarin, etc.) Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Epidemiological studies of the case-control and cohort design that have demonstrated an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding have also shown that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin may potentiate the risk of bleeding. Altered anticoagulant effects, including increased bleeding, have been reported when SSRIs and SNRIs are coadministered with warfarin. Patients receiving warfarin therapy should be carefully monitored when citalopram HBr is initiated or discontinued. Cimetidine In subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram HBr, combined administration of 400 mg/day cimetidine for 8 days resulted in an increase in citalopram AUC and C max of 43% and 39%, respectively. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Digoxin In subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram HBr, combined administration of citalopram HBr and digoxin (single dose of 1 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or digoxin. Lithium Coadministration of citalopram HBr (40 mg/day for 10 days) and lithium (30 mmol/day for 5 days) had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram or lithium. Nevertheless, plasma lithium levels should be monitored with appropriate adjustment to the lithium dose in accordance with standard clinical practice. Because lithium may enhance the serotonergic effects of citalopram, caution should be exercised when citalopram HBr and lithium are coadministered. Pimozide In a controlled study, a single dose of pimozide 2 mg co-administered with citalopram 40 mg given once daily for 11 days was associated with a mean increase in QTc values of approximately 10 msec compared to pimozide given alone. Citalopram did not alter the mean AUC or C max of pimozide. The mechanism of this pharmacodynamic interaction is not known. Theophylline Combined administration of citalopram HBr (40 mg/day for 21 days) and the CYP1A2 substrate theophylline (single dose of 300 mg) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. The effect of theophylline on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram was not evaluated. Sumatriptan There have been rare postmarketing reports describing patients with weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination following the use of a SSRI and sumatriptan. If concomitant treatment with sumatriptan and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised. Warfarin Administration of 40 mg/day citalopram HBr for 21 days did not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, a CYP3A4 substrate. Prothrombin time was increased by 5%, the clinical significance of which is unknown. Carbamazepine Combined administration of citalopram HBr (40 mg/day for 14 days) and carbamazepine (titrated to 400 mg/day for 35 days) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 substrate. Although trough citalopram plasma levels were unaffected, given the enzyme-inducing properties of carbamazepine, the possibility that carbamazepine might increase the clearance of citalopram should be considered if the two drugs are coadministered. Triazolam Combined administration of citalopram HBr (titrated to 40 mg/day for 28 days) and the CYP3A4 substrate triazolam (single dose of 0.25 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or triazolam. Ketoconazole Combined administration of citalopram HBr (40 mg) and ketoconazole (200 mg) decreased the C max and AUC of ketoconazole by 21% and 10%, respectively, and did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. CYP3A4 and 2C19 Inhibitors In vitro studies indicated that CYP3A4 and 2C19 are the primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of citalopram. However, coadministration of citalopram (40 mg) and ketoconazole (200 mg), a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. Because citalopram is metabolized by multiple enzyme systems, inhibition of a single enzyme may not appreciably decrease citalopram clearance. Metoprolol Administration of 40 mg/day citalopram HBr for 22 days resulted in a two-fold increase in the plasma levels of the beta-adrenergic blocker metoprolol. Increased metoprolol plasma levels have been associated with decreased cardioselectivity. Coadministration of citalopram HBr and metoprolol had no clinically significant effects on blood pressure or heart rate. Imipramine and Other Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) In vitro studies suggest that citalopram is a relatively weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. Coadministration of citalopram HBr (40 mg/day for 10 days) with the TCA imipramine (single dose of 100 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, did not significantly affect the plasma concentrations of imipramine or citalopram. However, the concentration of the imipramine metabolite desipramine was increased by approximately 50%. The clinical significance of the desipramine change is unknown. Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the coadministration of TCAs with citalopram HBr.. Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) There are no clinical studies of the combined use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and citalopram HBr."

No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Most elderly patients treated with citalopram HBr in clinical trials received daily doses between 20 and 40 mg (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). SSRIs and SNRIs, including citalopram HBr, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse event (see PRECAUTIONS, Hyponatremia ). In two pharmacokinetic studies, citalopram AUC was increased by 23% and 30%, respectively, in elderly subjects as compared to younger subjects, and its half-life was increased by 30% and 50%, respectively (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). 20 mg/day is the recommended dose for most elderly patients (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

        "PRECAUTIONS General Discontinuation of Treatment with Citalopram HBr During marketing of citalopram HBr and other SSRIs and SNRIs (serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), there have been spontaneous reports of adverse events occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias such as electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, and hypomania. While these events are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms. Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with citalopram HBr. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Abnormal Bleeding SSRIs and SNRIs, including citalopram HBr, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to the risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Bleeding events related to SSRIs and SNRIs use have ranged from ecchymoses, hematomas, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages. Patients should be cautioned about the risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of citalopram HBr and NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation. Hyponatremia Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SSRIs and SNRIs, including citalopram HBr. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), and was reversible when citalopram HBr. was discontinued. Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SSRIs and SNRIs. Also, patients taking diuretics or who are otherwise volume depleted may be at greater risk (see Geriatric Use). Discontinuation of citalopram HBr.should be considered in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia and appropriate medical intervention should be instituted. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and/or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death. Activation of Mania/Hypomania In placebo-controlled trials of citalopram HBr, some of which included patients with bipolar disorder, activation of mania/hypomania was reported in 0.2% of 1063 patients treated with citalopram HBr and in none of the 446 patients treated with placebo. Activation of mania/hypomania has also been reported in a small proportion of patients with major affective disorders treated with other marketed antidepressants. As with all antidepressants, citalopram HBr should be used cautiously in patients with a history of mania. Seizures Although anticonvulsant effects of citalopram have been observed in animal studies, citalopram HBr has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a seizure disorder. These patients were excluded from clinical studies during the product's premarketing testing. In clinical trials of citalopram HBr, seizures occurred in 0.3% of patients treated with citalopram HBr (a rate of one patient per 98 years of exposure) and 0.5% of patients treated with placebo (a rate of one patient per 50 years of exposure). Like other antidepressants, citalopram HBr should be introduced with care in patients with a history of seizure disorder. Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance In studies in normal volunteers, citalopram HBr in doses of 40 mg/day did not produce impairment of intellectual function or psychomotor performance. Because any psychoactive drug may impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, however, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that citalopram HBr therapy does not affect their ability to engage in such activities. Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness Clinical experience with citalopram HBr in patients with certain concomitant systemic illnesses is limited. Caution is advisable in using citalopram HBr in patients with diseases or conditions that produce altered metabolism or hemodynamic responses. Citalopram HBr has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease. Patients with these diagnoses were generally excluded from clinical studies during the product's premarketing testing. However, the electrocardiograms of 1116 patients who received citalopram HBr in clinical trials were evaluated and the data indicate that citalopram HBr is not associated with the development of clinically significant ECG abnormalities. In subjects with hepatic impairment, citalopram clearance was decreased and plasma concentrations were increased. The use of citalopram HBr in hepatically impaired patients should be approached with caution and a lower maximum dosage is recommended (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Because citalopram is extensively metabolized, excretion of unchanged drug in urine is a minor route of elimination. Until adequate numbers of patients with severe renal impairment have been evaluated during chronic treatment with citalopram HBr, however, it should be used with caution in such patients (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Information for Patients Physicians are advised to discuss the following issues with patients for whom they prescribe citalopram HBr. Patients should be cautioned about the risk of serotonin syndrome with the concomitant use of citalopram HBr and triptans, tramadol or other serotonergic agents. Although in controlled studies citalopram HBr has not been shown to impair psychomotor performance, any psychoactive drug may impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, so patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that citalopram HBr therapy does not affect their ability to engage in such activities. Patients should be told that, although citalopram HBr has not been shown in experiments with normal subjects to increase the mental and motor skill impairments caused by alcohol, the concomitant use of citalopram HBr and alcohol in depressed patients is not advised. Patients should be advised to inform their physician if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, as there is a potential for interactions. Patients should be cautioned about the concomitant use of citalopram HBr and NSAIDs, aspirin, warfarin, or other drugs that affect coagulation since combined use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and these agents has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy. Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they are breastfeeding an infant. While patients may notice improvement with citalopram HBr therapy in 1 to 4 weeks, they should be advised to continue therapy as directed. Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with citalopram HBr and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide about \u201cAntidepressant Medicines, Depression and other Serious Mental Illness, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions\u201d is available for citalopram HBr. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document. Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking citalopram HBr. Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication. Laboratory Tests There are no specific laboratory tests recommended. Drug Interactions Serotonergic Drugs Based on the mechanism of action of SNRIs and SSRIs including citalopram HBr, and the potential for serotonin syndrome, caution is advised when citalopram HBr is coadministered with other drugs that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems, such as triptans, linezolid (an antibiotic which is a reversible non-selective MAOI), lithium, tramadol, or St. John's Wort (see WARNINGS-Serotonin Syndrome ). The concomitant use of citalopram HBr with other SSRIs, SNRIs or tryptophan is not recommended (see PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions ). Triptans There have been rare postmarketing reports of serotonin syndrome with use of an SSRI and a triptan. If concomitant treatment of citalopram HBr with a triptan is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases (see WARNINGS - Serotonin Syndrome ). CNS Drugs Given the primary CNS effects of citalopram, caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs. Alcohol Although citalopram did not potentiate the cognitive and motor effects of alcohol in a clinical trial, as with other psychotropic medications, the use of alcohol by depressed patients taking citalopram HBr is not recommended. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS . Drugs That Interfere With Hemostasis (NSAIDs, Aspirin, Warfarin, etc.) Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Epidemiological studies of the case-control and cohort design that have demonstrated an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding have also shown that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin may potentiate the risk of bleeding. Altered anticoagulant effects, including increased bleeding, have been reported when SSRIs and SNRIs are coadministered with warfarin. Patients receiving warfarin therapy should be carefully monitored when citalopram HBr is initiated or discontinued. Cimetidine In subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram HBr, combined administration of 400 mg/day cimetidine for 8 days resulted in an increase in citalopram AUC and C max of 43% and 39%, respectively. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Digoxin In subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram HBr, combined administration of citalopram HBr and digoxin (single dose of 1 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or digoxin. Lithium Coadministration of citalopram HBr (40 mg/day for 10 days) and lithium (30 mmol/day for 5 days) had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram or lithium. Nevertheless, plasma lithium levels should be monitored with appropriate adjustment to the lithium dose in accordance with standard clinical practice. Because lithium may enhance the serotonergic effects of citalopram, caution should be exercised when citalopram HBr and lithium are coadministered. Pimozide In a controlled study, a single dose of pimozide 2 mg co-administered with citalopram 40 mg given once daily for 11 days was associated with a mean increase in QTc values of approximately 10 msec compared to pimozide given alone. Citalopram did not alter the mean AUC or C max of pimozide. The mechanism of this pharmacodynamic interaction is not known. Theophylline Combined administration of citalopram HBr (40 mg/day for 21 days) and the CYP1A2 substrate theophylline (single dose of 300 mg) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. The effect of theophylline on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram was not evaluated. Sumatriptan There have been rare postmarketing reports describing patients with weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination following the use of a SSRI and sumatriptan. If concomitant treatment with sumatriptan and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised. Warfarin Administration of 40 mg/day citalopram HBr for 21 days did not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, a CYP3A4 substrate. Prothrombin time was increased by 5%, the clinical significance of which is unknown. Carbamazepine Combined administration of citalopram HBr (40 mg/day for 14 days) and carbamazepine (titrated to 400 mg/day for 35 days) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 substrate. Although trough citalopram plasma levels were unaffected, given the enzyme-inducing properties of carbamazepine, the possibility that carbamazepine might increase the clearance of citalopram should be considered if the two drugs are coadministered. Triazolam Combined administration of citalopram HBr (titrated to 40 mg/day for 28 days) and the CYP3A4 substrate triazolam (single dose of 0.25 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or triazolam. Ketoconazole Combined administration of citalopram HBr (40 mg) and ketoconazole (200 mg) decreased the C max and AUC of ketoconazole by 21% and 10%, respectively, and did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. CYP3A4 and 2C19 Inhibitors In vitro studies indicated that CYP3A4 and 2C19 are the primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of citalopram. However, coadministration of citalopram (40 mg) and ketoconazole (200 mg), a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. Because citalopram is metabolized by multiple enzyme systems, inhibition of a single enzyme may not appreciably decrease citalopram clearance. Metoprolol Administration of 40 mg/day citalopram HBr for 22 days resulted in a two-fold increase in the plasma levels of the beta-adrenergic blocker metoprolol. Increased metoprolol plasma levels have been associated with decreased cardioselectivity. Coadministration of citalopram HBr and metoprolol had no clinically significant effects on blood pressure or heart rate. Imipramine and Other Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) In vitro studies suggest that citalopram is a relatively weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. Coadministration of citalopram HBr (40 mg/day for 10 days) with the TCA imipramine (single dose of 100 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, did not significantly affect the plasma concentrations of imipramine or citalopram. However, the concentration of the imipramine metabolite desipramine was increased by approximately 50%. The clinical significance of the desipramine change is unknown. Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the coadministration of TCAs with citalopram HBr.. Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) There are no clinical studies of the combined use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and citalopram HBr. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Citalopram was administered in the diet to NMRI/BOM strain mice and COBS WI strain rats for 18 and 24 months, respectively. There was no evidence for carcinogenicity of citalopram in mice receiving up to 240 mg/kg/day, which is equivalent to 20 times the maximum recommended human daily dose (MRHD) of 60 mg on a surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. There was an increased incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats receiving 8 or 24 mg/kg/day, doses which are approximately 1.3 and 4 times the MRHD, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis. A no-effect dose for this finding was not established. The relevance of these findings to humans is unknown. Mutagenesis Citalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation. It was clastogenic in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay for chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Citalopram was not mutagenic in the in vitro mammalian forward gene mutation assay (HPRT) in mouse lymphoma cells or in a coupled in vitro/in vivo unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay in rat liver. It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays. Impairment of Fertility When citalopram was administered orally to 16 male and 24 female rats prior to and throughout mating and gestation at doses of 32, 48, and 72 mg/kg/day, mating was decreased at all doses, and fertility was decreased at doses \u2265 32 mg/kg/day, approximately 5 times the MRHD of 60 mg/day on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mg/kg/day, approximately 8 times the MRHD. Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C In animal reproduction studies, citalopram has been shown to have adverse effects on embryo/fetal and postnatal development, including teratogenic effects, when administered at doses greater than human therapeutic doses. In two rat embryo/fetal development studies, oral administration of citalopram (32, 56, or 112 mg/kg/day) to pregnant animals during the period of organogenesis resulted in decreased embryo/fetal growth and survival and an increased incidence of fetal abnormalities (including cardiovascular and skeletal defects) at the high dose, which is approximately 18 times the MRHD of 60 mg/day on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. This dose was also associated with maternal toxicity (clinical signs, decreased body weight gain). The developmental, no-effect dose of 56 mg/kg/day is approximately 9 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. In a rabbit study, no adverse effects on embryo/fetal development were observed at doses of up to 16 mg/kg/day, or approximately 5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. Thus, teratogenic effects were observed at a maternally toxic dose in the rat and were not observed in the rabbit. When female rats were treated with citalopram (4.8, 12.8, or 32 mg/kg/day) from late gestation through weaning, increased offspring mortality during the first 4 days after birth and persistent offspring growth retardation were observed at the highest dose, which is approximately 5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. The no-effect dose of 12.8 mg/kg/day is approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. Similar effects on offspring mortality and growth were seen when dams were treated throughout gestation and early lactation at doses \u2265 24 mg/kg/day, approximately 4 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. A no-effect dose was not determined in that study. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; therefore, citalopram should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects Neonates exposed to citalopram HBr and other SSRIs or SNRIs, late in the third trimester, have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs and SNRIs or, possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome (see WARNINGS ). Infants exposed to SSRIs in late pregnancy may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1to 2 per 1000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality. In a retrospective, case-control study of 377 women whose infants were born with PPHN and 836 women whose infants were born healthy, the risk for developing PPHN was approximately six-fold higher for infants exposed to SSRIs after the 20th week of gestation compared to infants who had not been exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. There is currently no corroborative evidence regarding the risk for PPHN following exposure to SSRIs in pregnancy; this is the first study that has investigated the potential risk. The study did not include enough cases with exposure to individual SSRIs to determine if all SSRIs posed similar levels of PPHN risk. When treating a pregnant woman with citalopram HBr during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider both the potential risks and benefits of treatment (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Physicians should note that in a prospective longitudinal study of 201 women with a history of major depression who were euthymic at the beginning of pregnancy, women who discontinued antidepressant medication during pregnancy were more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continued antidepressant medication. Labor and Delivery The effect of citalopram HBr on labor and delivery in humans is unknown. Nursing Mothers As has been found to occur with many other drugs, citalopram is excreted in human breast milk. There have been two reports of infants experiencing excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss in association with breastfeeding from a citalopram-treated mother; in one case, the infant was reported to recover completely upon discontinuation of citalopram by its mother and in the second case, no follow-up information was available. The decision whether to continue or discontinue either nursing or citalopram HBr therapy should take into account the risks of citalopram exposure for the infant and the benefits of citalopram HBr treatment for the mother. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population have not been established (see BOX WARNING and WARNINGS\u2014Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk ). Two placebo-controlled trials in 407 pediatric patients with MDD have been conducted with citalopram HBr, and the data were not sufficient to support a claim for use in pediatric patients. Anyone considering the use of citalopram HBr in a child or adolescent must balance the potential risks with the clinical need. Geriatric Use Of 4422 patients in clinical studies of citalopram HBr, 1357 were 60 and over, 1034 were 65 and over, and 457 were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Most elderly patients treated with citalopram HBr in clinical trials received daily doses between 20 and 40 mg (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). SSRIs and SNRIs, including citalopram HBr, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse event (see PRECAUTIONS, Hyponatremia ). In two pharmacokinetic studies, citalopram AUC was increased by 23% and 30%, respectively, in elderly subjects as compared to younger subjects, and its half-life was increased by 30% and 50%, respectively (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). 20 mg/day is the recommended dose for most elderly patients (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

      "pharmacodynamics": [
        "Pharmacodynamics The mechanism of action of citalopram HBr as an antidepressant is presumed to be linked to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT). In vitro and in vivo studies in animals suggest that citalopram is a highly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with minimal effects on norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) neuronal reuptake. Tolerance to the inhibition of 5-HT uptake is not induced by long-term (14-day) treatment of rats with citalopram. Citalopram is a racemic mixture (50/50), and the inhibition of 5-HT reuptake by citalopram is primarily due to the (S)-enantiomer. Citalopram has no or very low affinity for 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 2A , dopamine D 1 and D 2 , \u03b1 1 -, \u03b1 2 -, and \u03b2-adrenergic, histamine H 1 , gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), muscarinic cholinergic, and benzodiazepine receptors. Antagonism of muscarinic, histaminergic, and adrenergic receptors has been hypothesized to be associated with various anticholinergic, sedative, and cardiovascular effects of other psychotropic drugs."

        "General Discontinuation of Treatment with Citalopram HBr During marketing of citalopram HBr and other SSRIs and SNRIs (serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), there have been spontaneous reports of adverse events occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias such as electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, and hypomania. While these events are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms. Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with citalopram HBr. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Abnormal Bleeding SSRIs and SNRIs, including citalopram HBr, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to the risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Bleeding events related to SSRIs and SNRIs use have ranged from ecchymoses, hematomas, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages. Patients should be cautioned about the risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of citalopram HBr and NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation. Hyponatremia Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SSRIs and SNRIs, including citalopram HBr. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), and was reversible when citalopram HBr. was discontinued. Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SSRIs and SNRIs. Also, patients taking diuretics or who are otherwise volume depleted may be at greater risk (see Geriatric Use). Discontinuation of citalopram HBr.should be considered in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia and appropriate medical intervention should be instituted. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and/or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death. Activation of Mania/Hypomania In placebo-controlled trials of citalopram HBr, some of which included patients with bipolar disorder, activation of mania/hypomania was reported in 0.2% of 1063 patients treated with citalopram HBr and in none of the 446 patients treated with placebo.

        "Pharmacokinetics The single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of citalopram are linear and dose-proportional in a dose range of 10-60 mg/day. Biotransformation of citalopram is mainly hepatic, with a mean terminal half-life of about 35 hours. With once daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within approximately one week. At steady state, the extent of accumulation of citalopram in plasma, based on the half-life, is expected to be 2.5 times the plasma concentrations observed after a single dose. The tablet and oral solution dosage forms of citalopram HBr are bioequivalent. Absorption and Distribution Following a single oral dose (40 mg tablet) of citalopram, peak blood levels occur at about 4 hours. The absolute bioavailability of citalopram was about 80% relative to an intravenous dose, and absorption is not affected by food. The volume of distribution of citalopram is about 12 L/kg and the binding of citalopram (CT), demethylcitalopram (DCT) and didemethylcitalopram (DDCT) to human plasma proteins is about 80%. Metabolism and Elimination Following intravenous administrations of citalopram, the fraction of drug recovered in the urine as citalopram and DCT was about 10% and 5%, respectively. The systemic clearance of citalopram was 330 mL/min, with approximately 20% of that due to renal clearance. Citalopram is metabolized to demethylcitalopram (DCT), didemethylcitalopram (DDCT), citalopram-N-oxide, and a deaminated propionic acid derivative. In humans, unchanged citalopram is the predominant compound in plasma. At steady state, the concentrations of citalopram's metabolites, DCT and DDCT, in plasma are approximately one-half and one-tenth, respectively, that of the parent drug. In vitro studies show that citalopram is at least 8 times more potent than its metabolites in the inhibition of serotonin reuptake, suggesting that the metabolites evaluated do not likely contribute significantly to the antidepressant actions of citalopram. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicated that CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary isozymes involved in the N-demethylation of citalopram. Population Subgroups Age Citalopram pharmacokinetics in subjects \u2265 60 years of age were compared to younger subjects in two normal volunteer studies. In a single-dose study, citalopram AUC and half-life were increased in the elderly subjects by 30% and 50%, respectively, whereas in a multiple-dose study they were increased by 23% and 30%, respectively. 20 mg is the recommended dose for most elderly patients (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Gender In three pharmacokinetic studies (total N=32), citalopram AUC in women was one and a half to two times that in men. This difference was not observed in five other pharmacokinetic studies (total N=114). In clinical studies, no differences in steady state serum citalopram levels were seen between men (N=237) and women (N=388). There were no gender differences in the pharmacokinetics of DCT and DDCT. No adjustment of dosage on the basis of gender is recommended. Reduced hepatic function Citalopram oral clearance was reduced by 37% and half-life was doubled in patients with reduced hepatic function compared to normal subjects. 20 mg is the recommended dose for most hepatically impaired patients (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Reduced renal function In patients with mild to moderate renal function impairment, oral clearance of citalopram was reduced by 17% compared to normal subjects. No adjustment of dosage for such patients is recommended. No information is available about the pharmacokinetics of citalopram in patients with severely reduced renal function (creatinine clearance < 20 mL/min). Drug-Drug Interactions In vitro enzyme inhibition data did not reveal an inhibitory effect of citalopram on CYP3A4, -2C9, or -2E1, but did suggest that it is a weak inhibitor of CYP1A2, -2D6, and -2C19. Citalopram would be expected to have little inhibitory effect on in vivo metabolism mediated by these cytochromes. However, in vivo data to address this question are limited. Since CYP3A4 and 2C19 are the primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of citalopram, it is expected that potent inhibitors of 3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and macrolide antibiotics) and potent inhibitors of CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole) might decrease the clearance of citalopram. However, coadministration of citalopram and the potent 3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. Because citalopram is metabolized by multiple enzyme systems, inhibition of a single enzyme may not appreciably decrease citalopram clearance. Citalopram steady state levels were not significantly different in poor metabolizers and extensive 2D6 metabolizers after multiple-dose administration of citalopram HBr, suggesting that coadministration, with citalopram HBr, of a drug that inhibits CYP2D6, is unlikely to have clinically significant effects on citalopram metabolism. See Drug Interactions under PRECAUTIONS for more detailed information on available drug interaction data."

      "indications_and_usage": [
        "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Citalopram HBr is indicated for the treatment of depression. The efficacy of citalopram HBr in the treatment of depression was established in 4 to 6 week, controlled trials of outpatients whose diagnosis corresponded most closely to the DSM-III and DSM-III-R category of major depressive disorder (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). A major depressive episode (DSM-IV) implies a prominent and relatively persistent (nearly every day for at least 2 weeks) depressed or dysphoric mood that usually interferes with daily functioning, and includes at least five of the following nine symptoms: depressed mood, loss of interest in usual activities, significant change in weight and/or appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation or retardation, increased fatigue, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, slowed thinking or impaired concentration, a suicide attempt or suicidal ideation. The antidepressant action of citalopram HBr in hospitalized depressed patients has not been adequately studied. The efficacy of citalopram HBr in maintaining an antidepressant response for up to 24 weeks following 6 to 8 weeks of acute treatment was demonstrated in two placebo-controlled trials (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use citalopram HBr for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient."

      "drug_abuse_and_dependence": [
        "DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Controlled Substance Class Citalopram HBr is not a controlled substance. Physical and Psychological Dependence Animal studies suggest that the abuse liability of citalopram HBr is low. Citalopram HBr has not been systematically studied in humans for its potential for abuse, tolerance, or physical dependence. The premarketing clinical experience with citalopram HBr did not reveal any drug-seeking behavior. However, these observations were not systematic and it is not possible to predict, on the basis of this limited experience, the extent to which a CNS-active drug will be misused, diverted, and/or abused once marketed. Consequently, physicians should carefully evaluate citalopram HBr patients for history of drug abuse and follow such patients closely, observing them for signs of misuse or abuse (e.g., development of tolerance, incrementations of dose, drug-seeking behavior)."

      "pregnancy": [
        "Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C In animal reproduction studies, citalopram has been shown to have adverse effects on embryo/fetal and postnatal development, including teratogenic effects, when administered at doses greater than human therapeutic doses. In two rat embryo/fetal development studies, oral administration of citalopram (32, 56, or 112 mg/kg/day) to pregnant animals during the period of organogenesis resulted in decreased embryo/fetal growth and survival and an increased incidence of fetal abnormalities (including cardiovascular and skeletal defects) at the high dose, which is approximately 18 times the MRHD of 60 mg/day on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. This dose was also associated with maternal toxicity (clinical signs, decreased body weight gain). The developmental, no-effect dose of 56 mg/kg/day is approximately 9 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. In a rabbit study, no adverse effects on embryo/fetal development were observed at doses of up to 16 mg/kg/day, or approximately 5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. Thus, teratogenic effects were observed at a maternally toxic dose in the rat and were not observed in the rabbit. When female rats were treated with citalopram (4.8, 12.8, or 32 mg/kg/day) from late gestation through weaning, increased offspring mortality during the first 4 days after birth and persistent offspring growth retardation were observed at the highest dose, which is approximately 5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. The no-effect dose of 12.8 mg/kg/day is approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. Similar effects on offspring mortality and growth were seen when dams were treated throughout gestation and early lactation at doses \u2265 24 mg/kg/day, approximately 4 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. A no-effect dose was not determined in that study. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; therefore, citalopram should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects Neonates exposed to citalopram HBr and other SSRIs or SNRIs, late in the third trimester, have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs and SNRIs or, possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome (see WARNINGS ). Infants exposed to SSRIs in late pregnancy may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1to 2 per 1000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality. In a retrospective, case-control study of 377 women whose infants were born with PPHN and 836 women whose infants were born healthy, the risk for developing PPHN was approximately six-fold higher for infants exposed to SSRIs after the 20th week of gestation compared to infants who had not been exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. There is currently no corroborative evidence regarding the risk for PPHN following exposure to SSRIs in pregnancy; this is the first study that has investigated the potential risk. The study did not include enough cases with exposure to individual SSRIs to determine if all SSRIs posed similar levels of PPHN risk. When treating a pregnant woman with citalopram HBr during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider both the potential risks and benefits of treatment (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Physicians should note that in a prospective longitudinal study of 201 women with a history of major depression who were euthymic at the beginning of pregnancy, women who discontinued antidepressant medication during pregnancy were more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continued antidepressant medication."

The decision whether to continue or discontinue either nursing or citalopram HBr therapy should take into account the risks of citalopram exposure for the infant and the benefits of citalopram HBr treatment for the mother."

Depression and certain other psychiatric disorders are themselves associated with increases in the risk of suicide. Patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber. Citalopram HBr is not approved for use in pediatric patients.

        "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Initial Treatment Citalopram HBr should be administered at an initial dose of 20 mg once daily, generally with an increase to a dose of 40 mg/day. Dose increases should usually occur in increments of 20 mg at intervals of no less than one week. Although certain patients may require a dose of 60 mg/day, the only study pertinent to dose response for effectiveness did not demonstrate an advantage for the 60 mg/day dose over the 40 mg/day dose; doses above 40 mg are therefore not ordinarily recommended. Citalopram HBr should be administered once daily, in the morning or evening, with or without food. Special Populations 20 mg/day is the recommended dose for most elderly patients and patients with hepatic impairment, with titration to 40 mg/day only for nonresponding patients. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Citalopram HBr should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment. Treatment of Pregnant Women During the Third Trimester Neonates exposed to citalopram HBr and other SSRIs or SNRIs, late in the third trimester, have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding (see PRECAUTIONS ). When treating pregnant women with citalopram HBr during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of treatment. The physician may consider tapering citalopram HBr in the third trimester. Maintenance Treatment It is generally agreed that acute episodes of depression require several months or longer of sustained pharmacologic therapy. Systematic evaluation of citalopram HBr in two studies has shown that its antidepressant efficacy is maintained for periods of up to 24 weeks following 6 or 8 weeks of initial treatment (32 weeks total). In one study, patients were assigned randomly to placebo or to the same dose of citalopram HBr (20-60 mg/day) during maintenance treatment as they had received during the acute stabilization phase, while in the other study, patients were assigned randomly to continuation of citalopram HBr 20 or 40 mg/day, or placebo, for maintenance treatment. In the latter study, the rates of relapse to depression were similar for the two dose groups (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Based on these limited data, it is not known whether the dose of citalopram needed to maintain euthymia is identical to the dose needed to induce remission. If adverse reactions are bothersome, a decrease in dose to 20 mg/day can be considered. Discontinuation of Treatment with Citalopram HBr Symptoms associated with discontinuation of citalopram HBr and other SSRIs and SNRIs have been reported (see PRECAUTIONS ). Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate. Switching Patients To or From a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI and initiation of citalopram HBr therapy. Similarly, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping citalopram HBr before starting an MAOI (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS )."

      "adverse_reactions": [
        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The premarketing development program for citalopram HBr included citalopram exposures in patients and/or normal subjects from 3 different groups of studies: 429 normal subjects in clinical pharmacology/pharmacokinetic studies; 4422 exposures from patients in controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials, corresponding to approximately 1370 patient-exposure years. There were, in addition, over 19,000 exposures from mostly open-label, European postmarketing studies. The conditions and duration of treatment with citalopram HBr varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories) open-label and double-blind studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, fixed-dose and dose-titration studies, and short-term and long-term exposure. Adverse reactions were assessed by collecting adverse events, results of physical examinations, vital signs, weights, laboratory analyses, ECGs, and results of ophthalmologic examinations. Adverse events during exposure were obtained primarily by general inquiry and recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tables and tabulations that follow, standard World Health Organization (WHO) terminology has been used to classify reported adverse events. The stated frequencies of adverse events represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatment-emergent adverse event of the type listed. An event was considered treatment-emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. Adverse Findings Observed in Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled Trials Adverse Events Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment Among 1063 depressed patients who received citalopram HBr at doses ranging from 10 to 80 mg/day in placebo-controlled trials of up to 6 weeks in duration, 16% discontinued treatment due to an adverse event, as compared to 8% of 446 patients receiving placebo. The adverse events associated with discontinuation and considered drug-related (i.e., associated with discontinuation in at least 1% of citalopram HBr-treated patients at a rate at least twice that of placebo) are shown in TABLE 2 . It should be noted that one patient can report more than one reason for discontinuation and be counted more than once in this table. TABLE 2 Adverse Events Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled, Depression Trials Percentage of Patients Discontinuing Due to Adverse Event Citalopram Placebo (N=1063) (N=446) Body System/Adverse Event General Asthenia 1% <1% Gastrointestinal Disorders Nausea 4% 0% Dry Mouth 1% <1% Vomiting 1% 0% Central and Peripheral Nervous System Disorders Dizziness 2% <1% Psychiatric Disorders Insomnia 3% 1% Somnolence 2% 1% Agitation 1% <1% Adverse Events Occurring at an Incidence of 2% or More Among Citalopram HBr-Treated Patients Table 3 enumerates the incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred among 1063 depressed patients who received citalopram HBr at doses ranging from 10 to 80 mg/day in placebo-controlled trials of up to 6 weeks in duration. Events included are those occurring in 2% or more of patients treated with citalopram HBr and for which the incidence in patients treated with citalopram HBr was greater than the incidence in placebo-treated patients. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those which prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and non-drug factors to the adverse event incidence rate in the population studied. The only commonly observed adverse event that occurred in citalopram HBr patients with an incidence of 5% or greater and at least twice the incidence in placebo patients was ejaculation disorder (primarily ejaculatory delay) in male patients (see TABLE 3 ). TABLE 3 Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events: Incidence in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials* *Events reported by at least 2% of patients treated with citalopram HBr are reported, except for the following events which had an incidence on placebo \u2265 citalopram HBr: headache, asthenia, dizziness, constipation, palpitation, vision abnormal, sleep disorder, nervousness, pharyngitis, micturition disorder, back pain. 1 Denominator used was for females only (N=638 citalopram HBr; N=252 placebo). 2 Primarily ejaculatory delay. 3 Denominator used was for males only (N=425 citalopram HBr; N=194 placebo).

Jonckheere's trend test revealed a positive dose response (p<0.05) for the following adverse events: fatigue, impotence, insomnia, sweating increased, somnolence, and yawning. Male and Female Sexual Dysfunction with SSRIs Although changes in sexual desire, sexual performance, and sexual satisfaction often occur as manifestations of a psychiatric disorder, they may also be a consequence of pharmacologic treatment. In particular, some evidence suggests that SSRIs can cause such untoward sexual experiences. Reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of untoward experiences involving sexual desire, performance, and satisfaction are difficult to obtain, however, in part because patients and physicians may be reluctant to discuss them. Accordingly, estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance cited in product labeling, are likely to underestimate their actual incidence. The table below displays the incidence of sexual side effects reported by at least 2% of patients taking citalopram HBr in a pool of placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with depression. Treatment Citalopram HBr (425 males) Placebo (194 males) Abnormal Ejaculation (mostly ejaculatory delay) 6.1% (males only) 1% (males only) Libido Decreased 3.8% (males only) <1% (males only) Impotence 2.8% (males only) <1% (males only) In female depressed patients receiving citalopram HBr, the reported incidence of decreased libido and anorgasmia was 1.3% (n=638 females) and 1.1% (n=252 females), respectively. There are no adequately designed studies examining sexual dysfunction with citalopram treatment. Priapism has been reported with all SSRIs. While it is difficult to know the precise risk of sexual dysfunction associated with the use of SSRIs, physicians should routinely inquire about such possible side effects. Vital Sign Changes Citalopram HBr and placebo groups were compared with respect to (1) mean change from baseline in vital signs (pulse, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure) and (2) the incidence of patients meeting criteria for potentially clinically significant changes from baseline in these variables. These analyses did not reveal any clinically important changes in vital signs associated with citalopram HBr treatment. In addition, a comparison of supine and standing vital sign measures for citalopram HBr and placebo treatments indicated that citalopram HBr treatment is not associated with orthostatic changes. Weight Changes Patients treated with citalopram HBr in controlled trials experienced a weight loss of about 0.5 kg compared to no change for placebo patients. Laboratory Changes Citalopram HBr and placebo groups were compared with respect to (1) mean change from baseline in various serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis variables, and (2) the incidence of patients meeting criteria for potentially clinically significant changes from baseline in these variables. These analyses revealed no clinically important changes in laboratory test parameters associated with citalopram HBr treatment. ECG Changes Electrocardiograms from citalopram HBr (N=802) and placebo (N=241) groups were compared with respect to (1) mean change from baseline in various ECG parameters, and (2) the incidence of patients meeting criteria for potentially clinically significant changes from baseline in these variables. The only statistically significant drug-placebo difference observed was a decrease in heart rate for citalopram HBr of 1.7 bpm compared to no change in heart rate for placebo. There were no observed differences in QT or other ECG intervals. Other Events Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Citalopram HBr Following is a list of WHO terms that reflect treatment-emergent adverse events, as defined in the introduction to the ADVERSE REACTIONS section, reported by patients treated with citalopram HBr at multiple doses in a range of 10 to 80 mg/day during any phase of a trial within the premarketing database of 4422 patients. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 3 or elsewhere in labeling, those events for which a drug cause was remote, those event terms which were so general as to be uninformative, and those occurring in only one patient. It is important to emphasize that, although the events reported occurred during treatment with citalopram HBr, they were not necessarily caused by it. Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse events are those occurring in less than 1/100 patients but at least 1/1000 patients; rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.

        "ANIMAL TOXICOLOGY Retinal Changes in Rats Pathologic changes (degeneration/atrophy) were observed in the retinas of albino rats in the 2-year carcinogenicity study with citalopram. There was an increase in both incidence and severity of retinal pathology in both male and female rats receiving 80 mg/kg/day (13 times the maximum recommended daily human dose of 60 mg on a mg/m 2 basis). Similar findings were not present in rats receiving 24 mg/kg/day for two years, in mice treated for 18 months at doses up to 240 mg/kg/day, or in dogs treated for one year at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (4, 20, and 10 times, respectively, the maximum recommended daily human dose on a mg/m 2 basis). Additional studies to investigate the mechanism for this pathology have not been performed, and the potential significance of this effect in humans has not been established. Cardiovascular Changes in Dogs In a one-year toxicology study, 5 of 10 beagle dogs receiving oral doses of 8 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum recommended daily human dose of 60 mg on a mg/m 2 basis) died suddenly between weeks 17 and 31 following initiation of treatment. Although appropriate data from that study are not available to directly compare plasma levels of citalopram (CT) and its metabolites, demethylcitalopram (DCT) and didemethylcitalopram (DDCT), to levels that have been achieved in humans, pharmacokinetic data indicate that the relative dog-to-human exposure was greater for the metabolites than for citalopram. Sudden deaths were not observed in rats at doses up to 120 mg/kg/day, which produced plasma levels of CT, DCT, and DDCT similar to those observed in dogs at doses of 8 mg/kg/day. A subsequent intravenous dosing study demonstrated that in beagle dogs, DDCT caused QT prolongation, a known risk factor for the observed outcome in dogs. This effect occurred in dogs at doses producing peak DDCT plasma levels of 810 to 3250 nM (39-155 times the mean steady state DDCT plasma level measured at the maximum recommended human daily dose of 60 mg). In dogs, peak DDCT plasma concentrations are approximately equal to peak CT plasma concentrations, whereas in humans, steady state DDCT plasma concentrations are less than 10% of steady state CT plasma concentrations. Assays of DDCT plasma concentrations in 2020 citalopram-treated individuals demonstrated that DDCT levels rarely exceeded 70 nM; the highest measured level of DDCT in human overdose was 138 nM. While DDCT is ordinarily present in humans at lower levels than in dogs, it is unknown whether there are individuals who may achieve higher DDCT levels. The possibility that DCT, a principal metabolite in humans, may prolong the QT interval in dogs has not been directly examined because DCT is rapidly converted to DDCT in that species. APOTEX INC.

        "WARNINGS-Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1 . TABLE 1 Age Range Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1000 Patients Treated Drug-Related Increases <18 14 additional cases 18-24 5 additional cases Drug-Related Decreases 25-64 1 fewer case \u226565 6 fewer cases No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression. All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases. The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality. Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that abrupt discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\u2014Discontinuation of Treatment with citalopram HBr , for a description of the risks of discontinuation of citalopram HBr. Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for citalopram HBr should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that citalopram HBr is not approved for use in treating bipolar depression. Potential for Interaction with Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors In patients receiving serotonin reuptake inhibitor drugs in combination with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions including hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuations of vital signs, and mental status changes that include extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma. These reactions have also been reported in patients who have recently discontinued SSRI treatment and have been started on an MAOI. Some cases presented with features resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Furthermore, limited animal data on the effects of combined use of SSRIs and MAOIs suggest that these drugs may act synergistically to elevate blood pressure and evoke behavioral excitation. Therefore, it is recommended that citalopram HBr should not be used in combination with an MAOI, or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with an MAOI. Similarly, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping citalopram HBr before starting an MAOI. Serotonin Syndrome The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome may occur with SNRIs and SSRIs, including citalopram HBr treatment, particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (including triptans) and with drugs which impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAOIs). Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The concomitant use of citalopram HBr with MAOIs intended to treat depression is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS - Potential for Interaction with Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors .) If concomitant treatment of citalopram HBr with a 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor agonist (triptan) is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases (see PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions ).The concomitant use of citalopram HBr with serotonin precursors (such as tryptophan) is not recommended (see PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions )."

        "Information for Patients Physicians are advised to discuss the following issues with patients for whom they prescribe citalopram HBr. Patients should be cautioned about the risk of serotonin syndrome with the concomitant use of citalopram HBr and triptans, tramadol or other serotonergic agents. Although in controlled studies citalopram HBr has not been shown to impair psychomotor performance, any psychoactive drug may impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, so patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that citalopram HBr therapy does not affect their ability to engage in such activities. Patients should be told that, although citalopram HBr has not been shown in experiments with normal subjects to increase the mental and motor skill impairments caused by alcohol, the concomitant use of citalopram HBr and alcohol in depressed patients is not advised. Patients should be advised to inform their physician if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, as there is a potential for interactions. Patients should be cautioned about the concomitant use of citalopram HBr and NSAIDs, aspirin, warfarin, or other drugs that affect coagulation since combined use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and these agents has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy. Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they are breastfeeding an infant. While patients may notice improvement with citalopram HBr therapy in 1 to 4 weeks, they should be advised to continue therapy as directed. Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with citalopram HBr and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide about \u201cAntidepressant Medicines, Depression and other Serious Mental Illness, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions\u201d is available for citalopram HBr. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document. Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking citalopram HBr. Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication."

        "MEDICATION GUIDE Antidepressant Medicines, Depression and Other Serious Mental Illnesses, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions Read the Medication Guide that comes with your or your family member\u2019s antidepressant medicine. This Medication Guide is only about the risk of suicidal thoughts and actions with antidepressant medicines. Talk to your, or your family member\u2019s, healthcare provider about: \u2022 all risks and benefits of treatment with antidepressant medicines \u2022 all treatment choices for depression or other serious mental illness What is the most important information I should know about antidepressant medicines, depression and other serious mental illnesses, and suicidal thoughts or actions? 1. Antidepressant medicines may increase suicidal thoughts and actions in some children, teenagers, and young adults within the first few months of treatment. 2. Depression and other serious mental illnesses are the most important causes of suicidal thoughts and actions. Some people may have a particularly high risk of having suicidal thoughts or actions. These include people who have (or have a family history of) bipolar illness (also called manic-depressive illness) or suicidal thoughts or actions. 3. How can I watch for and try to prevent suicidal thoughts and actions in myself or a family member? \u2022 Pay close attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. This is very important when an antidepressant is started or when the dose is changed. \u2022 Call the healthcare provider right away to report new or sudden changes in mood, behavior, thoughts, or feelings. \u2022 Keep all follow-up visits with the healthcare provider as scheduled. Call the healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you have concerns about symptoms. Call a healthcare provider right away if you or your family member has any of the following symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you: \u2022 thoughts about suicide or dying \u2022 attempts to commit suicide \u2022 new or worse depression \u2022 new or worse anxiety \u2022 feeling very agitated or restless \u2022 panic attacks \u2022 trouble sleeping (insomnia) \u2022 new or worse irritability \u2022 acting aggressive, being angry, or violent \u2022 acting on dangerous impulses \u2022 an extreme increase in activity and talking (mania) \u2022 other unusual changes in behavior or mood What else do I need to know about antidepressant medicines? \u2022 Never stop an antidepressant medicine without first talking to a healthcare provider. Stopping an antidepressant medicine suddenly can cause other symptoms. \u2022 Antidepressants are medicines used to treat depression and other illnesses . It is important to discuss all the risks of treating depression and also the risks of not treating it. Patients and their families or other caregivers should discuss all treatment choices with the healthcare provider, not just the use of antidepressants. \u2022 Antidepressant medicines have other side effects. Talk to the healthcare provider about the side effects of the medicine prescribed for you or your family member. \u2022 Antidepressant medicines can interact with other medicines. Know all of the medicines that you or your family member takes. Keep a list of all medicines to show the healthcare provider. Do not start new medicines without first checking with your healthcare provider. \u2022 Not all antidepressant medicines prescribed for children are FDA approved for use in children. Talk to your child\u2019s healthcare provider for more information. This Medication Guide has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for all antidepressants. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. Revised: July 2008"

      "clinical_pharmacology": [
        "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacodynamics The mechanism of action of citalopram HBr as an antidepressant is presumed to be linked to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT). In vitro and in vivo studies in animals suggest that citalopram is a highly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with minimal effects on norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) neuronal reuptake. Tolerance to the inhibition of 5-HT uptake is not induced by long-term (14-day) treatment of rats with citalopram. Citalopram is a racemic mixture (50/50), and the inhibition of 5-HT reuptake by citalopram is primarily due to the (S)-enantiomer. Citalopram has no or very low affinity for 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 2A , dopamine D 1 and D 2 , \u03b1 1 -, \u03b1 2 -, and \u03b2-adrenergic, histamine H 1 , gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), muscarinic cholinergic, and benzodiazepine receptors. Antagonism of muscarinic, histaminergic, and adrenergic receptors has been hypothesized to be associated with various anticholinergic, sedative, and cardiovascular effects of other psychotropic drugs. Pharmacokinetics The single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of citalopram are linear and dose-proportional in a dose range of 10-60 mg/day. Biotransformation of citalopram is mainly hepatic, with a mean terminal half-life of about 35 hours. With once daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within approximately one week. At steady state, the extent of accumulation of citalopram in plasma, based on the half-life, is expected to be 2.5 times the plasma concentrations observed after a single dose. The tablet and oral solution dosage forms of citalopram HBr are bioequivalent. Absorption and Distribution Following a single oral dose (40 mg tablet) of citalopram, peak blood levels occur at about 4 hours. The absolute bioavailability of citalopram was about 80% relative to an intravenous dose, and absorption is not affected by food. The volume of distribution of citalopram is about 12 L/kg and the binding of citalopram (CT), demethylcitalopram (DCT) and didemethylcitalopram (DDCT) to human plasma proteins is about 80%. Metabolism and Elimination Following intravenous administrations of citalopram, the fraction of drug recovered in the urine as citalopram and DCT was about 10% and 5%, respectively. The systemic clearance of citalopram was 330 mL/min, with approximately 20% of that due to renal clearance. Citalopram is metabolized to demethylcitalopram (DCT), didemethylcitalopram (DDCT), citalopram-N-oxide, and a deaminated propionic acid derivative. In humans, unchanged citalopram is the predominant compound in plasma. At steady state, the concentrations of citalopram's metabolites, DCT and DDCT, in plasma are approximately one-half and one-tenth, respectively, that of the parent drug. In vitro studies show that citalopram is at least 8 times more potent than its metabolites in the inhibition of serotonin reuptake, suggesting that the metabolites evaluated do not likely contribute significantly to the antidepressant actions of citalopram. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicated that CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary isozymes involved in the N-demethylation of citalopram. Population Subgroups Age Citalopram pharmacokinetics in subjects \u2265 60 years of age were compared to younger subjects in two normal volunteer studies. In a single-dose study, citalopram AUC and half-life were increased in the elderly subjects by 30% and 50%, respectively, whereas in a multiple-dose study they were increased by 23% and 30%, respectively. 20 mg is the recommended dose for most elderly patients (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Gender In three pharmacokinetic studies (total N=32), citalopram AUC in women was one and a half to two times that in men. This difference was not observed in five other pharmacokinetic studies (total N=114). In clinical studies, no differences in steady state serum citalopram levels were seen between men (N=237) and women (N=388). There were no gender differences in the pharmacokinetics of DCT and DDCT. No adjustment of dosage on the basis of gender is recommended. Reduced hepatic function Citalopram oral clearance was reduced by 37% and half-life was doubled in patients with reduced hepatic function compared to normal subjects. 20 mg is the recommended dose for most hepatically impaired patients (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Reduced renal function In patients with mild to moderate renal function impairment, oral clearance of citalopram was reduced by 17% compared to normal subjects. No adjustment of dosage for such patients is recommended. No information is available about the pharmacokinetics of citalopram in patients with severely reduced renal function (creatinine clearance < 20 mL/min). Drug-Drug Interactions In vitro enzyme inhibition data did not reveal an inhibitory effect of citalopram on CYP3A4, -2C9, or -2E1, but did suggest that it is a weak inhibitor of CYP1A2, -2D6, and -2C19. Citalopram would be expected to have little inhibitory effect on in vivo metabolism mediated by these cytochromes. However, in vivo data to address this question are limited. Since CYP3A4 and 2C19 are the primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of citalopram, it is expected that potent inhibitors of 3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and macrolide antibiotics) and potent inhibitors of CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole) might decrease the clearance of citalopram. However, coadministration of citalopram and the potent 3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. Because citalopram is metabolized by multiple enzyme systems, inhibition of a single enzyme may not appreciably decrease citalopram clearance. Citalopram steady state levels were not significantly different in poor metabolizers and extensive 2D6 metabolizers after multiple-dose administration of citalopram HBr, suggesting that coadministration, with citalopram HBr, of a drug that inhibits CYP2D6, is unlikely to have clinically significant effects on citalopram metabolism. See Drug Interactions under PRECAUTIONS for more detailed information on available drug interaction data. Clinical Efficacy Trials The efficacy of citalopram HBr as a treatment for depression was established in two placebo-controlled studies (of 4 to 6 weeks in duration) in adult outpatients (ages 18-66) meeting DSM-III or DSM-III-R criteria for major depression. Study 1, a 6-week trial in which patients received fixed citalopram HBr doses of 10, 20, 40, and 60 mg/day, showed that citalopram HBr at doses of 40 and 60 mg/day was effective as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) total score, the HAMD depressed mood item (Item 1), the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Severity scale. This study showed no clear effect of the 10 and 20 mg/day doses, and the 60 mg/day dose was not more effective than the 40 mg/day dose. In study 2, a 4-week, placebo-controlled trial in depressed patients, of whom 85% met criteria for melancholia, the initial dose was 20 mg/day, followed by titration to the maximum tolerated dose or a maximum dose of 80 mg/day. Patients treated with citalopram HBr showed significantly greater improvement than placebo patients on the HAMD total score, HAMD item 1, and the CGI Severity score. In three additional placebo-controlled depression trials, the difference in response to treatment between patients receiving citalopram HBr and patients receiving placebo was not statistically significant, possibly due to high spontaneous response rate, smaller sample size, or, in the case of one study, too low a dose. In two long-term studies, depressed patients who had responded to citalopram HBr during an initial 6 or 8 weeks of acute treatment (fixed doses of 20 or 40 mg/day in one study and flexible doses of 20-60 mg/day in the second study) were randomized to continuation of citalopram HBr or to placebo. In both studies, patients receiving continued citalopram HBr treatment experienced significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 6 months compared to those receiving placebo. In the fixed-dose study, the decreased rate of depression relapse was similar in patients receiving 20 or 40 mg/day of citalopram HBr. Analyses of the relationship between treatment outcome and age, gender, and race did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of these patient characteristics. Comparison of Clinical Trial Results Highly variable results have been seen in the clinical development of all antidepressant drugs. Furthermore, in those circumstances when the drugs have not been studied in the same controlled clinical trial(s), comparisons among the results of studies evaluating the effectiveness of different antidepressant drug products are inherently unreliable. Because conditions of testing (e.g., patient samples, investigators, doses of the treatments administered and compared, outcome measures, etc.) vary among trials, it is virtually impossible to distinguish a difference in drug effect from a difference due to one of the confounding factors just enumerated."

      "carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility": [
        "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Citalopram was administered in the diet to NMRI/BOM strain mice and COBS WI strain rats for 18 and 24 months, respectively. There was no evidence for carcinogenicity of citalopram in mice receiving up to 240 mg/kg/day, which is equivalent to 20 times the maximum recommended human daily dose (MRHD) of 60 mg on a surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. There was an increased incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats receiving 8 or 24 mg/kg/day, doses which are approximately 1.3 and 4 times the MRHD, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis. A no-effect dose for this finding was not established. The relevance of these findings to humans is unknown. Mutagenesis Citalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation. It was clastogenic in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay for chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Citalopram was not mutagenic in the in vitro mammalian forward gene mutation assay (HPRT) in mouse lymphoma cells or in a coupled in vitro/in vivo unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay in rat liver. It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays. Impairment of Fertility When citalopram was administered orally to 16 male and 24 female rats prior to and throughout mating and gestation at doses of 32, 48, and 72 mg/kg/day, mating was decreased at all doses, and fertility was decreased at doses \u2265 32 mg/kg/day, approximately 5 times the MRHD of 60 mg/day on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mg/kg/day, approximately 8 times the MRHD."

      "nonteratogenic_effects": [
        "Nonteratogenic Effects Neonates exposed to citalopram HBr and other SSRIs or SNRIs, late in the third trimester, have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs and SNRIs or, possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome (see WARNINGS ). Infants exposed to SSRIs in late pregnancy may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1to 2 per 1000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality. In a retrospective, case-control study of 377 women whose infants were born with PPHN and 836 women whose infants were born healthy, the risk for developing PPHN was approximately six-fold higher for infants exposed to SSRIs after the 20th week of gestation compared to infants who had not been exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. There is currently no corroborative evidence regarding the risk for PPHN following exposure to SSRIs in pregnancy; this is the first study that has investigated the potential risk. The study did not include enough cases with exposure to individual SSRIs to determine if all SSRIs posed similar levels of PPHN risk. When treating a pregnant woman with citalopram HBr during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider both the potential risks and benefits of treatment (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Physicians should note that in a prospective longitudinal study of 201 women with a history of major depression who were euthymic at the beginning of pregnancy, women who discontinued antidepressant medication during pregnancy were more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continued antidepressant medication."

      "overdosage": [
        "OVERDOSAGE Human Experience In clinical trials of citalopram, there were reports of citalopram overdose, including overdoses of up to 2000 mg, with no associated fatalities. During the postmarketing evaluation of citalopram, citalopram HBr overdoses, including overdoses of up to 6000 mg, have been reported. As with other SSRI\u2019s, a fatal outcome in a patient who has taken an overdose of citalopram has been rarely reported. Symptoms most often accompanying citalopram overdose, alone or in combination with other drugs and/or alcohol, included dizziness, sweating, nausea, vomiting, tremor, somnolence, and sinus tachycardia. In more rare cases, observed symptoms included amnesia, confusion, coma, convulsions, hyperventilation, cyanosis, rhabdomyolysis, and ECG changes (including QTc prolongation, nodal rhythm, ventricular arrhythmia, and very rare cases of torsade de pointes). Acute renal failure has been very rarely reported accompanying overdose. Management of Overdose Establish and maintain an airway to ensure adequate ventilation and oxygenation. Gastric evacuation by lavage and use of activated charcoal should be considered. Careful observation and cardiac and vital sign monitoring are recommended, along with general symptomatic and supportive care. Due to the large volume of distribution of citalopram, forced diuresis, dialysis, hemoperfusion, and exchange transfusion are unlikely to be of benefit. There are no specific antidotes for citalopram HBr. In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple-drug involvement. The physician should consider contacting a poison control center for additional information on the treatment of any overdose."

        "BOXED WARNING Suicidality and Antidepressant Drugs Antidepressants increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies of major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Anyone considering the use of Sertraline hydrochloride or any other antidepressant in a child, adolescent, or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. Depression and certain other psychiatric disorders are themselves associated with increases in the risk of suicide. Patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber. Sertraline hydrochloride tablets are not approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder in pediatric patients.

        "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacodynamics The mechanism of action of sertraline is presumed to be linked to its inhibition of CNS neuronal uptake of serotonin (5HT). Studies at clinically relevant doses in man have demonstrated that sertraline blocks the uptake of serotonin into human platelets. In vitro studies in animals also suggest that sertraline is a potent and selective inhibitor of neuronal serotonin reuptake and has only very weak effects on norepinephrine and dopamine neuronal reuptake. In vitro studies have shown that sertraline has no significant affinity for adrenergic (alpha 1 , alpha 2 , beta), cholinergic, GABA, dopaminergic, histaminergic, serotonergic (5HT 1A , 5HT 1B , 5H T2 ), or benzodiazepine receptors; antagonism of such receptors has been hypothesized to be associated with various anticholinergic, sedative, and cardiovascular effects for other psychotropic drugs. The chronic administration of sertraline was found in animals to downregulate brain norepinephrine receptors, as has been observed with other drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder. Sertraline does not inhibit monoamine oxidase. Pharmacokinetics Systemic Bioavailability \u2013In man, following oral once-daily dosing over the range of 50 to 200 mg for 14 days, mean peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of sertraline occurred between 4.5 to 8.4 hours post-dosing. The average terminal elimination half-life of plasma sertraline is about 26 hours. Based on this pharmacokinetic parameter, steady-state sertraline plasma levels should be achieved after approximately one week of once-daily dosing. Linear dose-proportional pharmacokinetics were demonstrated in a single dose study in which the C max and area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of sertraline were proportional to dose over a range of 50 to 200 mg. Consistent with the terminal elimination half-life, there is an approximately two-fold accumulation, compared to a single dose, of sertraline with repeated dosing over a 50 to 200 mg dose range. The single dose bioavailability of sertraline tablets is approximately equal to an equivalent dose of solution. In a relative bioavailability study comparing the pharmacokinetics of 100 mg sertraline as the oral solution to a 100 mg sertraline tablet in 16 healthy adults, the solution to tablet ratio of geometric mean AUC and C max values were 114.8% and 120.6%, respectively. 90% confidence intervals (CI) were within the range of 80-125% with the exception of the upper 90% CI limit for C max which was 126.5%. The effects of food on the bioavailability of the sertraline tablet and oral concentrate were studied in subjects administered a single dose with and without food. AUC was slightly increased when drug was administered with food but the C max was 25% greater, while the time to reach peak plasma concentration (T max ) decreased from 8 hours post-dosing to 5.5 hours. For the oral concentrate, T max was slightly prolonged from 5.9 hours to 7.0 hours with food. Metabolism \u2013Sertraline undergoes extensive first pass metabolism. The principal initial pathway of metabolism for sertraline is N-demethylation. N-desmethylsertraline has a plasma terminal elimination half-life of 62 to 104 hours. Both in vitro biochemical and in vivo pharmacological testing have shown N-desmethylsertraline to be substantially less active than sertraline. Both sertraline and N-desmethylsertraline undergo oxidative deamination and subsequent reduction, hydroxylation, and glucuronide conjugation. In a study of radiolabeled sertraline involving two healthy male subjects, sertraline accounted for less than 5% of the plasma radioactivity. About 40-45% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in urine in 9 days. Unchanged Sertraline was not detectable in the urine. For the same period, about 40-45% of the administered radioactivity was accounted for in feces, including 12-14% unchanged sertraline. Desmethylsertraline exhibits time-related, dose dependent increases in AUC (0-24 hour), C max and C min , with about a 5-9 fold increase in these pharmacokinetic parameters between day 1 and day 14. Protein Binding \u2013 In vitro protein binding studies performed with radiolabeled 3 H-sertraline showed that sertraline is highly bound to serum proteins (98%) in the range of 20 to 500 ng/mL. However, at up to 300 and 200 ng/mL concentrations, respectively, sertraline and N-desmethylsertraline did not alter the plasma protein binding of two other highly protein bound drugs, viz., warfarin and propranolol (see PRECAUTIONS ). Pediatric Pharmacokinetics \u2013Sertraline pharmacokinetics were evaluated in a group of 61 pediatric patients (29 aged 6 to12 years, 32 aged 13 to17 years). Patients included both males (N=28) and females (N=33). During 42 days of chronic sertraline dosing, sertraline was titrated up to 200 mg/day and maintained at that dose for a minimum of 11 days. On the final day of sertraline 200 mg/day, the 6-12 year old group exhibited a mean sertraline AUC (0-24 hr) of 3107 ng-hr/mL, mean C max of 165 ng/mL, and mean half-life of 26.2 hr. The 13-17 year old group exhibited a mean sertraline AUC (0-24 hr) of 2296 ng-hr/mL, mean C max of 123 ng/mL, and mean half-life of 27.8 hr. Higher plasma levels in the 6-12 year old group were largely attributable to patients with lower body weights. No gender associated differences were observed. By comparison, a group of 22 separately studied adults between 18 and 45 years of age (11 male, 11 female) received 30 days of 200 mg/day sertraline and exhibited a mean sertraline AUC (0-24 hr) of 2570 ng-hr/mL, mean C max of 142 ng/mL, and mean half-life of 27.2 hr. Relative to the adults, both the 6-12 year olds and the 13-17 year olds showed about 22% lower AUC (0-24 hr) and C max values when plasma concentration was adjusted for weight. These data suggest that pediatric patients metabolize sertraline with slightly greater efficiency than adults. Nevertheless, lower doses may be advisable for pediatric patients given their lower body weights, especially in very young patients, in order to avoid excessive plasma levels (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Age \u2013Sertraline plasma clearance in a group of 16 (8 male, 8 female) elderly patients treated for 14 days at a dose of 100 mg/day was approximately 40% lower than in a similarly studied group of younger (25 to 32 y.o.) individuals. Steady-state, therefore, should be achieved after 2 to 3 weeks in older patients. The same study showed a decreased clearance of desmethylsertraline in older males, but not in older females. Liver Disease \u2013As might be predicted from its primary site of metabolism, liver impairment can affect the elimination of sertraline. In patients with chronic mild liver impairment (N=10, 8 patients with Child-Pugh scores of 5-6 and 2 patients with Child-Pugh scores of 7-8) who received 50 mg sertraline per day maintained for 21 days, sertraline clearance was reduced, resulting in approximately 3-fold greater exposure compared to age-matched volunteers with no hepatic impairment (N=10). The exposure to desmethyl-sertraline was approximately 2-fold greater compared to age-matched volunteers with no hepatic impairment. There were no significant differences in plasma protein binding observed between the two groups. The effects of sertraline in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment have not been studied. The results suggest that the use of sertraline in patients with liver disease must be approached with caution. If sertraline is administered to patients with liver impairment, a lower or less frequent dose should be used (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Renal Disease \u2013Sertraline is extensively metabolized and excretion of unchanged drug in urine is a minor route of elimination. In volunteers with mild to moderate (CLcr =30-60 mL/min), moderate to severe (CLcr =10-29 mL/min) or severe (receiving hemodialysis) renal impairment (N=10 each group), the pharmacokinetics and protein binding of 200 mg sertraline per day maintained for 21 days were not altered compared to age-matched volunteers (N=12) with no renal impairment. Thus sertraline multiple dose pharmacokinetics appear to be unaffected by renal impairment (see PRECAUTIONS ). Clinical Trials Major Depressive Disorder \u2013The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride as a treatment for major depressive disorder was established in two placebo-controlled studies in adult outpatients meeting DSM-III criteria for major depressive disorder. Study 1 was an 8-week study with flexible dosing of sertraline hydrochloride in a range of 50 to 200 mg/day; the mean dose for completers was 145 mg/day. Study 2 was a 6-week fixed-dose study, including sertraline hydrochloride doses of 50, 100, and 200 mg/day. Overall, these studies demonstrated sertraline hydrochloride to be superior to placebo on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Clinical Global Impression Severity and Improvement scales. Study 2 was not readily interpretable regarding a dose response relationship for effectiveness. Study 3 involved depressed outpatients who had responded by the end of an initial 8-week open treatment phase on sertraline hydrochloride 50-200 mg/day. These patients (N=295) were randomized to continuation for 44 weeks on double-blind sertraline hydrochloride 50-200 mg/day or placebo. A statistically significantly lower relapse rate was observed for patients taking sertraline hydrochloride compared to those on placebo. The mean dose for completers was 70 mg/day. Analyses for gender effects on outcome did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of sex. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) \u2013The effectiveness of Sertraline hydrochloride in the treatment of OCD was demonstrated in three multicenter placebo-controlled studies of adult outpatients (Studies 1-3). Patients in all studies had moderate to severe OCD (DSM-III or DSM-III-R) with mean baseline ratings on the Yale\u2013Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) total score ranging from 23 to 25. Study 1 was an 8-week study with flexible dosing of Sertraline hydrochloride in a range of 50 to 200 mg/day; the mean dose for completers was 186 mg/day. Patients receiving Sertraline hydrochloride experienced a mean reduction of approximately 4 points on the YBOCS total score which was significantly greater than the mean reduction of 2 points in placebo-treated patients. Study 2 was a 12-week fixed-dose study, including Sertraline hydrochloride doses of 50, 100, and 200 mg/day. Patients receiving Sertraline hydrochloride doses of 50 and 200 mg/day experienced mean reductions of approximately 6 points on the YBOCS total score which were significantly greater than the approximately 3 point reduction in placebo-treated patients. Study 3 was a 12-week study with flexible dosing of Sertraline hydrochloride in a range of 50 to 200 mg/day; the mean dose for completers was 185 mg/day. Patients receiving Sertraline hydrochloride experienced a mean reduction of approximately 7 points on the YBOCS total score which was significantly greater than the mean reduction of approximately 4 points in placebo-treated patients. Analyses for age and gender effects on outcome did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of age or sex. The effectiveness of Sertraline hydrochloride for the treatment of OCD was also demonstrated in a 12-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled, parallel group study in a pediatric outpatient population (children and adolescents, ages 6-17). Patients receiving Sertraline hydrochloride in this study were initiated at doses of either 25 mg/day (children, ages 6-12) or 50 mg/day (adolescents, ages 13-17), and then titrated over the next four weeks to a maximum dose of 200 mg/day, as tolerated. The mean dose for completers was 178 mg/day. Dosing was once a day in the morning or evening. Patients in this study had moderate to severe OCD (DSM-III-R) with mean baseline ratings on the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CYBOCS) total score of 22. Patients receiving sertraline experienced a mean reduction of approximately 7 units on the CYBOCS total score which was significantly greater than the 3 unit reduction for placebo patients. Analyses for age and gender effects on outcome did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of age or sex. In a longer-term study, patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for OCD who had responded during a 52-week single-blind trial on Sertraline hydrochloride 50-200 mg/day (n=224) were randomized to continuation of Sertraline hydrochloride or to substitution of placebo for up to 28 weeks of observation for discontinuation due to relapse or insufficient clinical response. Response during the single-blind phase was defined as a decrease in the YBOCS score of \u2265 25% compared to baseline and a CGII of 1 (very much improved), 2 (much improved) or 3 (minimally improved). Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as the following conditions being met (on three consecutive visits for 1 and 2, and for visit 3 for condition 3): (1) YBOCS score increased by \u2265 5 points, to a minimum of 20, relative to baseline; (2) CGI-I increased by \u2265 one point; and (3) worsening of the patient's condition in the investigator's judgment, to justify alternative treatment. Insufficient clinical response indicated a worsening of the patient's condition that resulted in study discontinuation, as assessed by the investigator. Patients receiving continued Sertraline hydrochloride treatment experienced a significantly lower rate of discontinuation due to relapse or insufficient clinical response over the subsequent 28 weeks compared to those receiving placebo. This pattern was demonstrated in male and female subjects. Panic Disorder \u2013The effectiveness of Sertraline hydrochloride in the treatment of panic disorder was demonstrated in three double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1-3) of adult outpatients who had a primary diagnosis of panic disorder (DSM-III-R), with or without agoraphobia. Studies 1 and 2 were 10-week flexible dose studies. Sertraline hydrochloride was initiated at 25 mg/day for the first week, and then patients were dosed in a range of 50-200 mg/day on the basis of clinical response and toleration. The mean Sertraline hydrochloride doses for completers to 10 weeks were 131 mg/day and 144 mg/day, respectively, for Studies 1 and 2. In these studies, Sertraline hydrochloride was shown to be significantly more effective than placebo on change from baseline in panic attack frequency and on the Clinical Global Impression Severity of Illness and Global Improvement scores. The difference between Sertraline hydrochloride and placebo in reduction from baseline in the number of full panic attacks was approximately 2 panic attacks per week in both studies. Study 3 was a 12-week fixed-dose study, including Sertraline hydrochloride doses of 50, 100, and 200 mg/day. Patients receiving Sertraline hydrochloride experienced a significantly greater reduction in panic attack frequency than patients receiving placebo. Study 3 was not readily interpretable regarding a dose response relationship for effectiveness. Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were any differences in treatment outcomes as a function of age, race, or gender. In a longer-term study, patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for Panic Disorder who had responded during a 52-week open trial on Sertraline hydrochloride 50-200 mg/day (n=183) were randomized to continuation of Sertraline hydrochloride or to substitution of placebo for up to 28 weeks of observation for discontinuation due to relapse or insufficient clinical response. Response during the open phase was defined as a CGI-I score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved). Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as the following conditions being met on three consecutive visits: (1) CGI-I \u2265 3; (2) meets DSM-III-R criteria for Panic Disorder; (3) number of panic attacks greater than at baseline. Insufficient clinical response indicated a worsening of the patient's condition that resulted in study discontinuation, as assessed by the investigator. Patients receiving continued Sertraline hydrochloride treatment experienced a significantly lower rate of discontinuation due to relapse or insufficient clinical response over the subsequent 28 weeks compared to those receiving placebo. This pattern was demonstrated in male and female subjects. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) \u2013The effectiveness of Sertraline hydrochloride in the treatment of PTSD was established in two multicenter placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1-2) of adult outpatients who met DSM-III-R criteria for PTSD. The mean duration of PTSD for these patients was 12 years (Studies 1 and 2 combined) and 44% of patients (169 of the 385 patients treated) had secondary depressive disorder. Studies 1 and 2 were 12-week flexible dose studies. Sertraline hydrochloride was initiated at 25 mg/day for the first week, and patients were then dosed in the range of 50-200 mg/day on the basis of clinical response and toleration. The mean Sertraline hydrochloride dose for completers was 146 mg/day and 151 mg/day, respectively for Studies 1 and 2. Study outcome was assessed by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale Part 2 (CAPS) which is a multi-item instrument that measures the three PTSD diagnostic symptom clusters of reexperiencing/ intrusion, avoidance/numbing, and hyperarousal as well as the patient-rated Impact of Event Scale (IES) which measures intrusion and avoidance symptoms. Sertraline hydrochloride was shown to be significantly more effective than placebo on change from baseline to endpoint on the CAPS, IES and on the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) Severity of Illness and Global Improvement scores. In two additional placebo-controlled PTSD trials, the difference in response to treatment between patients receiving Sertraline hydrochloride and patients receiving placebo was not statistically significant. One of these additional studies was conducted in patients similar to those recruited for Studies 1 and 2, while the second additional study was conducted in predominantly male veterans. As PTSD is a more common disorder in women than men, the majority (76%) of patients in these trials were women (152 and 139 women on sertraline and placebo versus 39 and 55 men on sertraline and placebo; Studies 1 and 2 combined). Post hoc exploratory analyses revealed a significant difference between Sertraline hydrochloride and placebo on the CAPS, IES and CGI in women, regardless of baseline diagnosis of comorbid major depressive disorder, but essentially no effect in the relatively smaller number of men in these studies. The clinical significance of this apparent gender interaction is unknown at this time. There was insufficient information to determine the effect of race or age on outcome. In a longer-term study, patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for PTSD who had responded during a 24-week open trial on Sertraline hydrochloride 50-200 mg/day (n=96) were randomized to continuation of Sertraline hydrochloride or to substitution of placebo for up to 28 weeks of observation for relapse. Response during the open phase was defined as a CGI-I of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved), and a decrease in the CAPS-2 score of > 30% compared to baseline. Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as the following conditions being met on two consecutive visits: (1) CGI-I \u2265 3; (2) CAPS-2 score increased by \u2265 30% and by \u2265 15 points relative to baseline; and (3) worsening of the patient's condition in the investigator's judgment. Patients receiving continued Sertraline hydrochloride treatment experienced significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 28 weeks compared to those receiving placebo. This pattern was demonstrated in male and female subjects. Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) \u2013 The effectiveness of Sertraline hydrochloride for the treatment of PMDD was established in two double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled flexible dose trials (Studies 1 and 2) conducted over 3 menstrual cycles. Patients in Study 1 met DSM-III-R criteria for Late Luteal Phase Dysphoric Disorder (LLPDD), the clinical entity now referred to as Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) in DSM-IV. Patients in Study 2 met DSM-IV criteria for PMDD. Study 1 utilized daily dosing throughout the study, while Study 2 utilized luteal phase dosing for the 2 weeks prior to the onset of menses. The mean duration of PMDD symptoms for these patients was approximately 10.5 years in both studies. Patients on oral contraceptives were excluded from these trials; therefore, the efficacy of sertraline in combination with oral contraceptives for the treatment of PMDD is unknown. Efficacy was assessed with the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP), a patient-rated instrument that mirrors the diagnostic criteria for PMDD as identified in the DSM-IV, and includes assessments for mood, physical symptoms, and other symptoms. Other efficacy assessments included the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17), and the Clinical Global Impression Severity of Illness (CGI-S) and Improvement (CGI-I) scores. In Study 1, involving n=251 randomized patients, Sertraline hydrochloride treatment was initiated at 50 mg/day and administered daily throughout the menstrual cycle. In subsequent cycles, patients were dosed in the range of 50-150 mg/day on the basis of clinical response and toleration. The mean dose for completers was 102 mg/day. Sertraline hydrochloride administered daily throughout the menstrual cycle was significantly more effective than placebo on change from baseline to endpoint on the DRSP total score, the HAMD-17 total score, and the CGI-S score, as well as the CGI-I score at endpoint. In Study 2, involving n=281 randomized patients, Sertraline hydrochloride treatment was initiated at 50 mg/day in the late luteal phase (last 2 weeks) of each menstrual cycle and then discontinued at the onset of menses. In subsequent cycles, patients were dosed in the range of 50-100 mg/day in the luteal phase of each cycle, on the basis of clinical response and toleration. Patients who were titrated to 100 mg/day received 50 mg/day for the first 3 days of the cycle, then 100 mg/day for the remainder of the cycle. The mean sertraline hydrochloride dose for completers was 74 mg/day. Sertraline hydrochloride administered in the late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle was significantly more effective than placebo on change from baseline to endpoint on the DRSP total score and the CGI-S score, as well as the CGI-I score at endpoint. There was insufficient information to determine the effect of race or age on outcome in these studies. Social Anxiety Disorder \u2013 The effectiveness of Sertraline hydrochloride in the treatment of social anxiety disorder (also known as social phobia) was established in two multicenter placebo-controlled studies (Study 1 and 2) of adult outpatients who met DSM-IV criteria for social anxiety disorder. Study 1 was a 12-week, multicenter, flexible dose study comparing Sertraline hydrochloride (50-200 mg/day) to placebo, in which Sertraline hydrochloride was initiated at 25 mg/day for the first week. Study outcome was assessed by (a) the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), a 24-item clinician administered instrument that measures fear, anxiety and avoidance of social and performance situations, and by (b) the proportion of responders as defined by the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) criterion of CGI-I \u2264 2 (very much or much improved). Sertraline hydrochloride was statistically significantly more effective than placebo as measured by the LSAS and the percentage of responders. Study 2 was a 20-week, multicenter, flexible dose study that compared Sertraline hydrochloride (50-200 mg/day) to placebo. Study outcome was assessed by the (a) Duke Brief Social Phobia Scale (BSPS), a multi-item clinician-rated instrument that measures fear, avoidance and physiologic response to social or performance situations, (b) the Marks Fear Questionnaire Social Phobia Subscale (FQ-SPS), a 5-item patient-rated instrument that measures change in the severity of phobic avoidance and distress, and (c) the CGI-I responder criterion of \u2264 2. Sertraline hydrochloride was shown to be statistically significantly more effective than placebo as measured by the BSPS total score and fear, avoidance and physiologic factor scores, as well as the FQ-SPS total score, and to have significantly more responders than placebo as defined by the CGI-I. Subgroup analyses did not suggest differences in treatment outcome on the basis of gender. There was insufficient information to determine the effect of race or age on outcome. In a longer-term study, patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for social anxiety disorder who had responded while assigned to Sertraline hydrochloride (CGI-I of 1 or 2) during a 20-week placebo-controlled trial on Sertraline hydrochloride 50-200 mg/day were randomized to continuation of Sertraline hydrochloride or to substitution of placebo for up to 24 weeks of observation for relapse. Relapse was defined as \u2265 2 point increase in the Clinical Global Impression \u2013 Severity of Illness (CGI-S) score compared to baseline or study discontinuation due to lack of efficacy. Patients receiving Sertraline hydrochloride continuation treatment experienced a statistically significantly lower relapse rate over this 24-week study than patients randomized to placebo substitution."

In a relative bioavailability study comparing the pharmacokinetics of 100 mg sertraline as the oral solution to a 100 mg sertraline tablet in 16 healthy adults, the solution to tablet ratio of geometric mean AUC and C max values were 114.8% and 120.6%, respectively. 90% confidence intervals (CI) were within the range of 80-125% with the exception of the upper 90% CI limit for C max which was 126.5%. The effects of food on the bioavailability of the sertraline tablet and oral concentrate were studied in subjects administered a single dose with and without food. AUC was slightly increased when drug was administered with food but the C max was 25% greater, while the time to reach peak plasma concentration (T max ) decreased from 8 hours post-dosing to 5.5 hours. For the oral concentrate, T max was slightly prolonged from 5.9 hours to 7.0 hours with food. Metabolism \u2013Sertraline undergoes extensive first pass metabolism. The principal initial pathway of metabolism for sertraline is N-demethylation. N-desmethylsertraline has a plasma terminal elimination half-life of 62 to 104 hours. Both in vitro biochemical and in vivo pharmacological testing have shown N-desmethylsertraline to be substantially less active than sertraline. Both sertraline and N-desmethylsertraline undergo oxidative deamination and subsequent reduction, hydroxylation, and glucuronide conjugation. In a study of radiolabeled sertraline involving two healthy male subjects, sertraline accounted for less than 5% of the plasma radioactivity. About 40-45% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in urine in 9 days. Unchanged Sertraline was not detectable in the urine. For the same period, about 40-45% of the administered radioactivity was accounted for in feces, including 12-14% unchanged sertraline. Desmethylsertraline exhibits time-related, dose dependent increases in AUC (0-24 hour), C max and C min , with about a 5-9 fold increase in these pharmacokinetic parameters between day 1 and day 14. Protein Binding \u2013 In vitro protein binding studies performed with radiolabeled 3 H-sertraline showed that sertraline is highly bound to serum proteins (98%) in the range of 20 to 500 ng/mL. However, at up to 300 and 200 ng/mL concentrations, respectively, sertraline and N-desmethylsertraline did not alter the plasma protein binding of two other highly protein bound drugs, viz., warfarin and propranolol (see PRECAUTIONS ). Pediatric Pharmacokinetics \u2013Sertraline pharmacokinetics were evaluated in a group of 61 pediatric patients (29 aged 6 to12 years, 32 aged 13 to17 years). Patients included both males (N=28) and females (N=33). During 42 days of chronic sertraline dosing, sertraline was titrated up to 200 mg/day and maintained at that dose for a minimum of 11 days. On the final day of sertraline 200 mg/day, the 6-12 year old group exhibited a mean sertraline AUC (0-24 hr) of 3107 ng-hr/mL, mean C max of 165 ng/mL, and mean half-life of 26.2 hr. The 13-17 year old group exhibited a mean sertraline AUC (0-24 hr) of 2296 ng-hr/mL, mean C max of 123 ng/mL, and mean half-life of 27.8 hr. Higher plasma levels in the 6-12 year old group were largely attributable to patients with lower body weights. No gender associated differences were observed. By comparison, a group of 22 separately studied adults between 18 and 45 years of age (11 male, 11 female) received 30 days of 200 mg/day sertraline and exhibited a mean sertraline AUC (0-24 hr) of 2570 ng-hr/mL, mean C max of 142 ng/mL, and mean half-life of 27.2 hr. Relative to the adults, both the 6-12 year olds and the 13-17 year olds showed about 22% lower AUC (0-24 hr) and C max values when plasma concentration was adjusted for weight. These data suggest that pediatric patients metabolize sertraline with slightly greater efficiency than adults. Nevertheless, lower doses may be advisable for pediatric patients given their lower body weights, especially in very young patients, in order to avoid excessive plasma levels (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Age \u2013Sertraline plasma clearance in a group of 16 (8 male, 8 female) elderly patients treated for 14 days at a dose of 100 mg/day was approximately 40% lower than in a similarly studied group of younger (25 to 32 y.o.) individuals. Steady-state, therefore, should be achieved after 2 to 3 weeks in older patients. The same study showed a decreased clearance of desmethylsertraline in older males, but not in older females. Liver Disease \u2013As might be predicted from its primary site of metabolism, liver impairment can affect the elimination of sertraline. In patients with chronic mild liver impairment (N=10, 8 patients with Child-Pugh scores of 5-6 and 2 patients with Child-Pugh scores of 7-8) who received 50 mg sertraline per day maintained for 21 days, sertraline clearance was reduced, resulting in approximately 3-fold greater exposure compared to age-matched volunteers with no hepatic impairment (N=10). The exposure to desmethyl-sertraline was approximately 2-fold greater compared to age-matched volunteers with no hepatic impairment. There were no significant differences in plasma protein binding observed between the two groups. The effects of sertraline in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment have not been studied. The results suggest that the use of sertraline in patients with liver disease must be approached with caution. If sertraline is administered to patients with liver impairment, a lower or less frequent dose should be used (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Renal Disease \u2013Sertraline is extensively metabolized and excretion of unchanged drug in urine is a minor route of elimination. In volunteers with mild to moderate (CLcr =30-60 mL/min), moderate to severe (CLcr =10-29 mL/min) or severe (receiving hemodialysis) renal impairment (N=10 each group), the pharmacokinetics and protein binding of 200 mg sertraline per day maintained for 21 days were not altered compared to age-matched volunteers (N=12) with no renal impairment. Thus sertraline multiple dose pharmacokinetics appear to be unaffected by renal impairment (see PRECAUTIONS )."

        "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Major Depressive Disorder \u2013 Sertraline hydrochloride is indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder in adults. The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in the treatment of a major depressive episode was established in six to eight week controlled trials of adult outpatients whose diagnoses corresponded most closely to the DSM-III category of major depressive disorder (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). A major depressive episode implies a prominent and relatively persistent depressed or dysphoric mood that usually interferes with daily functioning (nearly every day for at least 2 weeks); it should include at least 4 of the following 8 symptoms: change in appetite, change in sleep, psychomotor agitation or retardation, loss of interest in usual activities or decrease in sexual drive, increased fatigue, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, slowed thinking or impaired concentration, and a suicide attempt or suicidal ideation. The antidepressant action of sertraline hydrochloride in hospitalized depressed patients has not been adequately studied. The efficacy of sertraline hydrochloride in maintaining an antidepressant response for up to 44 weeks following 8 weeks of open-label acute treatment (52 weeks total) was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial. The usefulness of the drug in patients receiving sertraline hydrochloride for extended periods should be reevaluated periodically (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder \u2013 Sertraline hydrochloride is indicated for the treatment of obsessions and compulsions in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), as defined in the DSM-III-R; i.e., the obsessions or compulsions cause marked distress, are time-consuming, or significantly interfere with social or occupational functioning. The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride was established in 12-week trials with obsessive-compulsive outpatients having diagnoses of obsessive-compulsive disorder as defined according to DSM-III or DSM-III-R criteria (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Obsessive-compulsive disorder is characterized by recurrent and persistent ideas, thoughts, impulses, or images (obsessions) that are ego-dystonic and/or repetitive, purposeful, and intentional behaviors (compulsions) that are recognized by the person as excessive or unreasonable. The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in maintaining a response, in patients with OCD who responded during a 52-week treatment phase while taking Sertraline hydrochloride and were then observed for relapse during a period of up to 28 weeks, was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use Sertraline hydrochloride for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Panic Disorder \u2013 Sertraline hydrochloride is indicated for the treatment of panic disorder in adults, with or without agoraphobia, as defined in DSM-IV. Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks, and/or a significant change in behavior related to the attacks. The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride was established in three 10-12 week trials in adult panic disorder patients whose diagnoses corresponded to the DSM-III-R category of panic disorder (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Panic disorder (DSM-IV) is characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks, i.e., a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort in which four (or more) of the following symptoms develop abruptly and reach a peak within 10 minutes: (1) palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate; (2) sweating; (3) trembling or shaking; (4) sensations of shortness of breath or smothering; (5) feeling of choking; (6) chest pain or discomfort; (7) nausea or abdominal distress; (8) feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded, or faint; (9) derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself); (10) fear of losing control; (11) fear of dying; (12) paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations); (13) chills or hot flushes. The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in maintaining a response, in adult patients with panic disorder who responded during a 52-week treatment phase while taking Sertraline hydrochloride and were then observed for relapse during a period of up to 28 weeks, was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use Sertraline hydrochloride for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) \u2013 Sertraline hydrochloride (sertraline hydrochloride) is indicated for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder in adults. The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in the treatment of PTSD was established in two 12-week placebo-controlled trials of adult outpatients whose diagnosis met criteria for the DSM-III-R category of PTSD (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). PTSD, as defined by DSM-III-R/IV, requires exposure to a traumatic event that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or threat to the physical integrity of self or others, and a response which involves intense fear, helplessness, or horror. Symptoms that occur as a result of exposure to the traumatic event include reexperiencing of the event in the form of intrusive thoughts, flashbacks or dreams, and intense psychological distress and physiological reactivity on exposure to cues to the event; avoidance of situations reminiscent of the traumatic event, inability to recall details of the event, and/or numbing of general responsiveness manifested as diminished interest in significant activities, estrangement from others, restricted range of affect, or sense of foreshortened future; and symptoms of autonomic arousal including hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, sleep disturbance, impaired concentration, and irritability or outbursts of anger. A PTSD diagnosis requires that the symptoms are present for at least a month and that they cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in maintaining a response in adult patients with PTSD for up to 28 weeks following 24 weeks of open-label treatment was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial. Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use Sertraline hydrochloride for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) \u2013 Sertraline hydrochloride is indicated for the treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) in adults. The efficacy of sertraline hydrochloride in the treatment of PMDD was established in 2 placebo-controlled trials of female adult outpatients treated for 3 menstrual cycles who met criteria for the DSM-IIIR/IV category of PMDD (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). The essential features of PMDD include markedly depressed mood, anxiety or tension, affective lability, and persistent anger or irritability. Other features include decreased interest in activities, difficulty concentrating, lack of energy, change in appetite or sleep, and feeling out of control. Physical symptoms associated with PMDD include breast tenderness, headache, joint and muscle pain, bloating and weight gain. These symptoms occur regularly during the luteal phase and remit within a few days following onset of menses; the disturbance markedly interferes with work or school or with usual social activities and relationships with others. In making the diagnosis, care should be taken to rule out other cyclical mood disorders that may be exacerbated by treatment with an antidepressant. The effectiveness of Sertraline hydrochloride in long-term use, that is, for more than 3 menstrual cycles, has not been systematically evaluated in controlled trials. Therefore, the physician who elects to use Sertraline hydrochloride for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Social Anxiety Disorder \u2013 Sertraline hydrochloride is indicated for the treatment of social anxiety disorder, also known as social phobia in adults. The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in the treatment of social anxiety disorder was established in two placebo-controlled trials of adult outpatients with a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder as defined by DSM-IV criteria (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Social anxiety disorder, as defined by DSM-IV, is characterized by marked and persistent fear of social or performance situations involving exposure to unfamiliar people or possible scrutiny by others and by fears of acting in a humiliating or embarrassing way. Exposure to the feared social situation almost always provokes anxiety and feared social or performance situations are avoided or else are endured with intense anxiety or distress. In addition, patients recognize that the fear is excessive or unreasonable and the avoidance and anticipatory anxiety of the feared situation is associated with functional impairment or marked distress. The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in maintaining a response in adult patients with social anxiety disorder for up to 24 weeks following 20 weeks of Sertraline hydrochloride treatment was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial. Physicians who prescribe Sertraline hydrochloride for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY )."

        "WARNINGS Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18-24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1. Table 1 Age Range Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1000 Patients Treated Increases Compared to placebo <18 14 additional cases 18-24 5 additional cases Decreases Compared to placebo 25-64 1 fewer case >65 6 fewer cases No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression. All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases. The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality. Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that abrupt discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2014Discontinuation of Treatment with sertraline hydrochloride, for a description of the risks of discontinuation of Sertraline hydrochloride). Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for Sertraline hydrochloride should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder: A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that sertraline hydrochloride is not approved for use in treating bipolar depression. Serotonin Syndrome: The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome has been reported with SNRIs and SSRIs, including Sertraline hydrochloride, alone but particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John's Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms(e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. The concomitant use of sertraline hydrochloride with MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders is contraindicated. Sertraline hydrochloride should also not be started in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. All reports with methylene blue that provided information on the route of administration involved intravenous administration in the dose range of 1 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection) or at lower doses. There may be circumstances when it is necessary to initiate treatment with a MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking sertraline hydrochloride. Sertraline hydrochloride should be discontinued before initiating treatment with the MAOI (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If concomitant use of sertraline hydrochloride with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, buspirone, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort is clinically warranted, patients should be made aware of a potential increased risk for serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases. Treatment with Sertraline hydrochloride and any concomitant serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately if the above events occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated. Angle-Closure Glaucoma: The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including sertraline may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy."

      "precautions": [
        "PRECAUTIONS General Activation of Mania/Hypomania \u2013During premarketing testing, hypomania or mania occurred in approximately 0.4% of sertraline hydrochloride treated patients. Weight Loss \u2013Significant weight loss may be an undesirable result of treatment with Sertraline for some patients, but on average, patients in controlled trials had minimal, 1 to 2 pound weight loss, versus smaller changes on placebo. Only rarely have sertraline patients been discontinued for weight loss. Seizure \u2013Sertraline hydrochloride has not been evaluated in patients with a seizure disorder. These patients were excluded from clinical studies during the product's premarket testing. No seizures were observed among approximately 3000 patients treated with sertraline hydrochloride in the development program for major depressive disorder. However, 4 patients out of approximately 1800 (220 <18 years of age) exposed during the development program for another disorder experienced seizures, representing a crude incidence of 0.2%. Three of these patients were adolescents, two with a seizure disorder and one with a family history of seizure disorder, none of whom were receiving anticonvulsant medication. Accordingly, sertraline hydrochloride should be introduced with care in patients with a seizure disorder. Discontinuation of Treatment with Sertraline hydrochloride During marketing of Sertraline hydrochloride and other SSRIs and SNRIs (Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors), there have been spontaneous reports of adverse events occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g. paresthesias such as electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, and hypomania. While these events are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms. Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with sertraline hydrochloride. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Abnormal Bleeding SSRIs and SNRIs, including Sertraline hydrochloride, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Bleeding events related to SSRIs and SNRIs use have ranged from ecchymoses, hematomas, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages. Patients should be cautioned about the risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of sertraline hydrochloride and NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation. Weak Uricosuric Effect \u2013 Sertraline hydrochloride is associated with a mean decrease in serum uric acid of approximately 7%. The clinical significance of this weak uricosuric effect is unknown. Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness \u2013Clinical experience with Sertraline hydrochloride in patients with certain concomitant systemic illness is limited. Caution is advisable in using sertraline hydrochloride in patients with diseases or conditions that could affect metabolism or hemodynamic responses. Patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease were excluded from clinical studies during the product's premarket testing. However, the electrocardiograms of 774 patients who received Sertraline hydrochloride in double-blind trials were evaluated and the data indicate that sertraline hydrochloride is not associated with the development of significant ECG abnormalities. Sertraline hydrochloride administered in a flexible dose range of 50 to 200 mg/day (mean dose of 89 mg/day) was evaluated in a post-marketing, placebo-controlled trial of 372 randomized subjects with a DSM-IV diagnosis of major depressive disorder and recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable angina requiring hospitalization. Exclusions from this trial included, among others, patients with uncontrolled hypertension, need for cardiac surgery, history of CABG within 3 months of index event, severe or symptomatic bradycardia, non-atherosclerotic cause of angina, clinically significant renal impairment (creatinine > 2.5 mg/dl), and clinically significant hepatic dysfunction. Sertraline hydrochloride treatment initiated during the acute phase of recovery (within 30 days post-MI or post-hospitalization for unstable angina) was indistinguishable from placebo in this study on the following week 16 treatment endpoints: left ventricular ejection fraction, total cardiovascular events (angina, chest pain, edema, palpitations, syncope, postural dizziness, CHF, MI, tachycardia, bradycardia, and changes in BP), and major cardiovascular events involving death or requiring hospitalization (for MI, CHF, stroke, or angina). Sertraline hydrochloride is extensively metabolized by the liver. In patients with chronic mild liver impairment, sertraline clearance was reduced, resulting in increased AUC, C max and elimination half-life. The effects of sertraline in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment have not been studied. The use of sertraline in patients with liver disease must be approached with caution. If sertraline is administered to patients with liver impairment, a lower or less frequent dose should be used (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Since Sertraline hydrochloride is extensively metabolized, excretion of unchanged drug in urine is a minor route of elimination. A clinical study comparing sertraline pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers to that in patients with renal impairment ranging from mild to severe (requiring dialysis) indicated that the pharmacokinetics and protein binding are unaffected by renal disease. Based on the pharmacokinetic results, there is no need for dosage adjustment in patients with renal impairment (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance \u2013In controlled studies, Sertraline hydrochloride did not cause sedation and did not interfere with psychomotor performance. (See Information for Patients.) Hyponatremia \u2013Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SSRIs and SNRIs, including sertraline hydrochloride. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SSRIs and SNRIs. Also, patients taking diuretics or who are otherwise volume depleted may be at greater risk (see GERIATRIC USE ). Discontinuation of sertraline hydrochloride should be considered in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia and appropriate medical intervention should be instituted. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and/or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death. Platelet Function \u2013 There have been rare reports of altered platelet function and/or abnormal results from laboratory studies in patients taking sertraline hydrochloride. While there have been reports of abnormal bleeding or purpura in several patients taking sertraline hydrochloride, it is unclear whether sertraline hydrochloride had a causative role. Information for Patients Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with sertraline hydrochloride and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide about \"Antidepressant Medicines, Depression and other Serious Mental Illness, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions\" is available for sertraline hydrochloride. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document. Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking Sertraline hydrochloride. Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk: Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication. Patients should be cautioned about the risk of serotonin syndrome with the concomitant use of SNRIs and SSRIs, including Sertraline hydrochloride, and triptans, tramadol, or other serotonergic agents. Patients should be told that although Sertraline hydrochloride has not been shown to impair the ability of normal subjects to perform tasks requiring complex motor and mental skills in laboratory experiments, drugs that act upon the central nervous system may affect some individuals adversely. Therefore, patients should be told that until they learn how they respond to Sertraline hydrochloride they should be careful doing activities when they need to be alert, such as driving a car or operating machinery. Patients should be cautioned about the concomitant use of sertraline hydrochloride and NSAIDs, aspirin, warfarin, or other drugs that affect coagulation since combined use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and these agents has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Patients should be told that although sertraline hydrochloride has not been shown in experiments with normal subjects to increase the mental and motor skill impairments caused by alcohol, the concomitant use of sertraline hydrochloride and alcohol is not advised. Patients should be told that while no adverse interaction of sertraline hydrochloride with over-the-counter (OTC) drug products is known to occur, the potential for interaction exists. Thus, the use of any OTC product should be initiated cautiously according to the directions of use given for the OTC product. Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy. Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they are breast feeding an infant. Laboratory Tests False-positive urine immunoassay screening tests for benzodiazepines have been reported in patients taking sertraline. This is due to lack of specificity of the screening tests. False-positive test results may be expected for several days following discontinuation of sertraline therapy. Confirmatory tests, such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, will distinguish sertraline from benzodiazepines. Drug Interactions Potential Effects of Coadministration of Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Proteins \u2013Because sertraline is tightly bound to plasma protein, the administration of sertraline hydrochloride to a patient taking another drug which is tightly bound to protein (e.g., warfarin, digitoxin) may cause a shift in plasma concentrations potentially resulting in an adverse effect. Conversely, adverse effects may result from displacement of protein bound sertraline hydrochloride by other tightly bound drugs. In a study comparing prothrombin time AUC (0-120 hr) following dosing with warfarin (0.75 mg/kg) before and after 21 days of dosing with either sertraline hydrochloride (50-200 mg/day) or placebo, there was a mean increase in prothrombin time of 8% relative to baseline for sertraline hydrochloride compared to a 1% decrease for placebo (p<0.02). The normalization of prothrombin time for the sertraline hydrochloride group was delayed compared to the placebo group. The clinical significance of this change is unknown. Accordingly, prothrombin time should be carefully monitored when sertraline hydrochloride therapy is initiated or stopped. Cimetidine \u2013In a study assessing disposition of sertraline hydrochloride (100 mg) on the second of 8 days of cimetidine administration (800 mg daily), there were significant increases in sertraline hydrochloride mean AUC (50%), C max (24%) and half-life (26%) compared to the placebo group. The clinical significance of these changes is unknown. CNS Active Drugs \u2013In a study comparing the disposition of intravenously administered diazepam before and after 21 days of dosing with either sertraline hydrochloride (50 to 200 mg/day escalating dose) or placebo, there was a 32% decrease relative to baseline in diazepam clearance for the sertraline hydrochloride group compared to a 19% decrease relative to baseline for the placebo group (p<0.03). There was a 23% increase in T max for desmethyldiazepam in the sertraline hydrochloride group compared to a 20% decrease in the placebo group (p<0.03). The clinical significance of these changes is unknown. In a placebo-controlled trial in normal volunteers, the administration of two doses of Sertraline hydrochloride did not significantly alter steady-state lithium levels or the renal clearance of lithium. Nonetheless, at this time, it is recommended that plasma lithium levels be monitored following initiation of Sertraline hydrochloride therapy with appropriate adjustments to the lithium dose. In a controlled study of a single dose (2 mg) of pimozide, 200 mg sertraline (q.d.) co-administration to steady state was associated with a mean increase in pimozide AUC and C max of about 40%, but was not associated with any changes in EKG. Since the highest recommended pimozide dose (10 mg) has not been evaluated in combination with sertraline, the effect on QT interval and PK parameters at doses higher than 2 mg at this time are not known. While the mechanism of this interaction is unknown, due to the narrow therapeutic index of pimozide and due to the interaction noted at a low dose of pimozide, concomitant administration of Sertraline hydrochloride and pimozide should be contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Results of a placebo-controlled trail in normal volunteers suggest that chronic administration of sertraline 200 mg/day does not produce clinically important inhibition of phenytoin metabolism. Nonetheless, at this time, it is recommended that plasma phenytoin concentrations be monitored following initiation of Sertraline Hydrochloride therapy with appropriate adjustments to the phenytoin dose, particularly in patients with multiple underlying medical conditions and/or those receiving multiple concomitant medications. The effect of Sertraline hydrochloride on valproate levels has not been evaluated in clinical trials. In the absence of such data, it is recommended that plasma valproate levels be monitored following initiation of Sertraline hydrochloride therapy with appropriate adjustments to the valproate dose. The risk of using sertraline hydrochloride in combination with other CNS active drugs has not been systematically evaluated. Consequently, caution is advised if the concomitant administration of sertraline hydrochloride and such drugs is required. There is limited controlled experience regarding the optimal timing of switching from other drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder to sertraline hydrochloride. Care and prudent medical judgment should be exercised when switching, particularly from long-acting agents. The duration of an appropriate washout period which should intervene before switching from one selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) to another has not been established. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors \u2013See CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . Drugs Metabolized by P450 3A4 \u2013In three separate in vivo interaction studies, sertraline was co-administered with cytochrome P450 3A4 substrates, terfenadine, carbamazepine, or cisapride under steady-state conditions. The results of these studies indicated that sertraline did not increase plasma concentrations of terfenadine, carbamazepine, or cisapride. These data indicate that sertraline's extent of inhibition of P450 3A4 activity is not likely to be of clinical significance. Results of the interaction study with cisapride indicate that sertraline 200 mg (q.d.) induces the metabolism of cisapride (cisapride AUC and C max were reduced by about 35%). Drugs Metabolized by P450 2D6 \u2013 Many drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder, e.g., the SSRIs, including sertraline, and most tricyclic antidepressant drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder inhibit the biochemical activity of the drug metabolizing isozyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (debrisoquin hydroxylase), and, thus, may increase the plasma concentrations of co-administered drugs that are metabolized by P450 2D6. The drugs for which this potential interaction is of greatest concern are those metabolized primarily by 2D6 and which have a narrow therapeutic index, e.g., the tricyclic antidepressant drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder and the Type 1C antiarrhythmics propafenone and flecainide. The extent to which this interaction is an important clinical problem depends on the extent of the inhibition of P450 2D6 by the antidepressant and the therapeutic index of the coadministered drug. There is variability among the drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder in the extent of clinically important 2D6 inhibition, and in fact sertraline at lower doses has a less prominent inhibitory effect on 2D6 than some others in the class. Nevertheless, even sertraline has the potential for clinically important 2D6 inhibition. Consequently, concomitant use of a drug metabolized by P450 2D6 with sertraline hydrochloride may require lower doses than usually prescribed for the other drug. Furthermore, whenever sertraline hydrochloride is withdrawn from co-therapy, an increased dose of the co-administered drug may be required (see Tricyclic Antidepressant Drugs Effective in the Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder under PRECAUTIONS). Serotonergic Drugs: see CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . Triptans: There have been rare post marketing reports of serotonin syndrome with use of an SNRI or an SSRI and a triptan. If concomitant treatment of SNRIs and SSRIs, including sertraline hydrochloride, with a triptan is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases (see WARNINGS \u2013 Serotonin Syndrome). Sumatriptan \u2013There have been rare postmarketing reports describing patients with weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination following the use of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and sumatriptan. If concomitant treatment with sumatriptan and an SSRI (e.g., citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised. Tricyclic Antidepressant Drugs Effective in the Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (TCAs) \u2013The extent to which SSRI\u2013TCA interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved. Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the co-administration of TCAs with sertraline hydrochloride, because sertraline may inhibit TCA metabolism. Plasma TCA concentrations may need to be monitored, and the dose of TCA may need to be reduced, if a TCA is co-administered with sertraline hydrochloride (see Drugs Metabolized by P450 2D6 under PRECAUTIONS ). Hypoglycemic Drugs \u2013In a placebo-controlled trial in normal volunteers, administration of sertraline hydrochloride for 22 days (including 200 mg/day for the final 13 days) caused a statistically significant 16% decrease from baseline in the clearance of tolbutamide following an intravenous 1000 mg dose. Sertraline hydrochloride administration did not noticeably change either the plasma protein binding or the apparent volume of distribution of tolbutamide, suggesting that the decreased clearance was due to a change in the metabolism of the drug. The clinical significance of this decrease in tolbutamide clearance is unknown. Atenolol \u2013 Sertraline hydrochloride (100 mg) when administered to 10 healthy male subjects had no effect on the beta-adrenergic blocking ability of atenolol. Digoxin \u2013In a placebo-controlled trial in normal volunteers, administration of sertraline hydrochloride for 17 days (including 200 mg/day for the last 10 days) did not change serum digoxin levels or digoxin renal clearance. Microsomal Enzyme Induction \u2013Preclinical studies have shown sertraline hydrochloride to induce hepatic microsomal enzymes. In clinical studies, sertraline hydrochloride was shown to induce hepatic enzymes minimally as determined by a small (5%) but statistically significant decrease in antipyrine half-life following administration of 200 mg/day for 21 days. This small change in antipyrine half-life reflects a clinically insignificant change in hepatic metabolism. Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (Non-selective NSAIDs, Aspirin, Warfarin, etc.) Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Epidemiological studies of the case-control and cohort design that have demonstrated an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding have also shown that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin may potentiate this risk of bleeding. These studies have also shown that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin may potentiate this risk of bleeding. Altered anticoagulant effects, including increased bleeding, have been reported when SSRIs or SNRIs are coadministered with warfarin. Patients receiving warfarin therapy should be carefully monitored when Sertraline hydrochloride is initiated or discontinued. Electroconvulsive Therapy \u2013There are no clinical studies establishing the risks or benefits of the combined use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and Sertraline hydrochloride. Alcohol \u2013Although Sertraline hydrochloride did not potentiate the cognitive and psychomotor effects of alcohol in experiments with normal subjects, the concomitant use of sertraline hydrochloride and alcohol is not recommended. Carcinogenesis \u2013Lifetime carcinogenicity studies were carried out in CD-1 mice and Long-Evans rats at doses up to 40 mg/kg/day. These doses correspond to 1 times (mice) and 2 times (rats) the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) on a mg/m2 basis. There was a dose-related increase of liver adenomas in male mice receiving sertraline at 10-40 mg/kg (0.25-1.0 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). No increase was seen in female mice or in rats of either sex receiving the same treatments, nor was there an increase in hepatocellular carcinomas. Liver adenomas have a variable rate of spontaneous occurrence in the CD-1 mouse and are of unknown significance to humans. There was an increase in follicular adenomas of the thyroid in female rats receiving sertraline at 40 mg/kg (2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis); this was not accompanied by thyroid hyperplasia. While there was an increase in uterine adenocarcinomas in rats receiving sertraline at 10-40 mg/kg (0.5-2.0 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) compared to placebo controls, this effect was not clearly drug related. Mutagenesis \u2013Sertraline had no genotoxic effects, with or without metabolic activation, based on the following assays: bacterial mutation assay; mouse lymphoma mutation assay; and tests for cytogenetic aberrations in vivo in mouse bone marrow and in vitro in human lymphocytes. Impairment of Fertility \u2013A decrease in fertility was seen in one of two rat studies at a dose of 80 mg/kg (4 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis). Pregnancy\u2013Pregnancy Category C \u2013Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 80 mg/kg/day and 40 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses correspond to approximately 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) on a mg/m 2 basis. There was no evidence of teratogenicity at any dose level. When pregnant rats and rabbits were given sertraline during the period of organogenesis, delayed ossification was observed in fetuses at doses of 10 mg/kg (0.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) in rats and 40 mg/kg (4 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) in rabbits. When female rats received sertraline during the last third of gestation and throughout lactation, there was an increase in the number of stillborn pups and in the number of pups dying during the first 4 days after birth. Pup body weights were also decreased during the first four days after birth. These effects occurred at a dose of 20 mg/kg (1 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). The no effect dose for rat pup mortality was 10 mg/kg (0.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). The decrease in pup survival was shown to be due to in utero exposure to sertraline. The clinical significance of these effects is unknown. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Sertraline hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Pregnancy-Nonteratogenic Effects \u2013Neonates exposed to sertraline hydrochloride and other SSRIs or SNRIs, late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. These findings are based on postmarketing reports. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs and SNRIs or, possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome (see WARNINGS :Serotonin Syndrome). Infants exposed to SSRIs in pregnancy may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1 \u2013 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality. Several recent epidemiologic studies suggest a positive statistical association between SSRI use (including sertraline hydrochloride) in pregnancy and PPHN. Other studies do not show a significant statistical association. Physicians should also note the results of a prospective longitudinal study of 201 pregnant women with a history of major depression, who were either on antidepressants or had received antidepressants less than 12 weeks prior to their last menstrual period, and were in remission. Women who discontinued antidepressant medication during pregnancy showed a significant increase in relapse of their major depression compared to those women who remained on antidepressant medication throughout pregnancy. When treating a pregnant woman with sertraline hydrochloride, the physician should carefully consider both the potential risks of taking an SSRI, along with the established benefits of treating depression with an antidepressant. This decision can only be made on a case by case basis (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Labor and Delivery \u2013The effect of sertraline hydrochloride on labor and delivery in humans is unknown. Nursing Mothers \u2013It is not known whether, and if so in what amount, sertraline or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when sertraline hydrochloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use \u2013 The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder was demonstrated in a 12-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled study with 187 outpatients ages 6-17 (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population other than pediatric patients with OCD have not been established (see BOX WARNING and WARNINGS -Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk). Two placebo controlled trials (n=373) in pediatric patients with MDD have been conducted with sertraline hydrochloride, and the data were not sufficient to support a claim for use in pediatric patients. Anyone considering the use of Sertraline hydrochloride in a child or adolescent must balance the potential risks with the clinical need. The safety of Sertraline hydrochloride use in children and adolescents with OCD, ages 6-18, was evaluated in a 12-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled study with 187 outpatients, ages 6-17, and in a flexible dose, 52 week open extension study of 137 patients, ages 6-18, who had completed the initial 12week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Sertraline hydrochloride was administered at doses of either 25 mg/day (children, ages 6-12) or 50 mg/day (adolescents, ages 13-18) and then titrated in weekly 25 mg/day or 50 mg/day increments, respectively, to a maximum dose of 200 mg/day based upon clinical response. The mean dose for completers was 157 mg/day. In the acute 12 week pediatric study and in the 52 week study, Sertraline hydrochloride had an adverse event profile generally similar to that observed in adults. Sertraline pharmacokinetics were evaluated in 61 pediatric patients between 6 and 17 years of age with major depressive disorder or OCD and revealed similar drug exposures to those of adults when plasma concentration was adjusted for weight (see Pharmacokinetics under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Approximately 600 patients with major depressive disorder or OCD between 6 and 17 years of age have received Sertraline hydrochloride in clinical trials, both controlled and uncontrolled. The adverse event profile observed in these patients was generally similar to that observed in adult studies with sertraline hydrochloride (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). As with other SSRIs, decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of Sertraline hydrochloride. In a pooled analysis of two 10-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible dose (50-200 mg) outpatient trials for major depressive disorder (n=373), there was a difference in weight change between sertraline and placebo of roughly 1 kilogram, for both children (ages 6-11) and adolescents (ages 12-17), in both cases representing a slight weight loss for sertraline compared to a slight gain for placebo. At baseline the mean weight for children was 39.0 kg for sertraline and 38.5 kg for placebo. At baseline the mean weight for adolescents was 61.4 kg for sertraline and 62.5 kg for placebo. There was a bigger difference between sertraline and placebo in the proportion of outliers for clinically important weight loss in children than in adolescents. For children, about 7% had a weight loss > 7% of body weight compared to none of the placebo patients; for adolescents, about 2% had a weight loss > 7% of body weight compared to about 1% of the placebo patients. A subset of these patients who completed the randomized controlled trials (sertraline n=99, placebo n=122) were continued into a 24-week, flexible-dose, open-label, extension study. A mean weight loss of approximately 0.5 kg was seen during the first eight weeks of treatment for subjects with first exposure to sertraline during the open-label extension study, similar to mean weight loss observed among sertraline treated subjects during the first eight weeks of the randomized controlled trials. The subjects continuing in the open label study began gaining weight compared to baseline by week 12 of sertraline treatment. Those subjects who completed 34 weeks of sertraline treatment (10 weeks in a placebo controlled trial + 24 weeks open label, n=68) had weight gain that was similar to that expected using data from age-adjusted peers. Regular monitoring of weight and growth is recommended if treatment of a pediatric patient with an SSRI is to be continued long term. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 6 have not been established. The risks, if any, that may be associated with Sertraline hydrochloride's use beyond 1 year in children and adolescents with OCD or major depressive disorder have not been systematically assessed. The prescriber should be mindful that the evidence relied upon to conclude that sertraline is safe for use in children and adolescents derives from clinical studies that were 10 to 52 weeks in duration and from the extrapolation of experience gained with adult patients. In particular, there are no studies that directly evaluate the effects of long-term sertraline use on the growth, development, and maturation of children and adolescents. Although there is no affirmative finding to suggest that sertraline possesses a capacity to adversely affect growth, development or maturation, the absence of such findings is not compelling evidence of the absence of the potential of sertraline to have adverse effects in chronic use (see WARNINGS \u2013 Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk). Geriatric Use \u2013U.S. geriatric clinical studies of Sertraline hydrochloride in major depressive disorder included 663 Sertraline hydrochloride -treated subjects \u2265 65 years of age, of those, 180 were \u2265 75 years of age. No overall differences in the pattern of adverse reactions were observed in the geriatric clinical trial subjects relative to those reported in younger subjects (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ), and other reported experience has not identified differences in safety patterns between the elderly and younger subjects. As with all medications, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. There were 947 subjects in placebo-controlled geriatric clinical studies of Sertraline hydrochloride in major depressive disorder. No overall differences in the pattern of efficacy were observed in the geriatric clinical trial subjects relative to those reported in younger subjects. Other Adverse Events in Geriatric Patients. In 354 geriatric subjects treated with Sertraline hydrochloride in placebo-controlled trials, the overall profile of adverse events was generally similar to that shown in Tables 2 and 3. Urinary tract infection was the only adverse event not appearing in Tables 2 and 3 and reported at an incidence of at least 2% and at a rate greater than placebo in placebo-controlled trials. SSRIS and SNRIs, including Sertraline hydrochloride, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse event (see PRECAUTIONS , Hyponatremia)."

Conversely, adverse effects may result from displacement of protein bound sertraline hydrochloride by other tightly bound drugs.

The normalization of prothrombin time for the sertraline hydrochloride group was delayed compared to the placebo group. The clinical significance of this change is unknown. Accordingly, prothrombin time should be carefully monitored when sertraline hydrochloride therapy is initiated or stopped. Cimetidine \u2013In a study assessing disposition of sertraline hydrochloride (100 mg) on the second of 8 days of cimetidine administration (800 mg daily), there were significant increases in sertraline hydrochloride mean AUC (50%), C max (24%) and half-life (26%) compared to the placebo group. The clinical significance of these changes is unknown. CNS Active Drugs \u2013In a study comparing the disposition of intravenously administered diazepam before and after 21 days of dosing with either sertraline hydrochloride (50 to 200 mg/day escalating dose) or placebo, there was a 32% decrease relative to baseline in diazepam clearance for the sertraline hydrochloride group compared to a 19% decrease relative to baseline for the placebo group (p<0.03). There was a 23% increase in T max for desmethyldiazepam in the sertraline hydrochloride group compared to a 20% decrease in the placebo group (p<0.03).

Care and prudent medical judgment should be exercised when switching, particularly from long-acting agents. The duration of an appropriate washout period which should intervene before switching from one selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) to another has not been established. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors \u2013See CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . Drugs Metabolized by P450 3A4 \u2013In three separate in vivo interaction studies, sertraline was co-administered with cytochrome P450 3A4 substrates, terfenadine, carbamazepine, or cisapride under steady-state conditions. The results of these studies indicated that sertraline did not increase plasma concentrations of terfenadine, carbamazepine, or cisapride. These data indicate that sertraline's extent of inhibition of P450 3A4 activity is not likely to be of clinical significance. Results of the interaction study with cisapride indicate that sertraline 200 mg (q.d.) induces the metabolism of cisapride (cisapride AUC and C max were reduced by about 35%). Drugs Metabolized by P450 2D6 \u2013 Many drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder, e.g., the SSRIs, including sertraline, and most tricyclic antidepressant drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder inhibit the biochemical activity of the drug metabolizing isozyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (debrisoquin hydroxylase), and, thus, may increase the plasma concentrations of co-administered drugs that are metabolized by P450 2D6. The drugs for which this potential interaction is of greatest concern are those metabolized primarily by 2D6 and which have a narrow therapeutic index, e.g., the tricyclic antidepressant drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder and the Type 1C antiarrhythmics propafenone and flecainide. The extent to which this interaction is an important clinical problem depends on the extent of the inhibition of P450 2D6 by the antidepressant and the therapeutic index of the coadministered drug. There is variability among the drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder in the extent of clinically important 2D6 inhibition, and in fact sertraline at lower doses has a less prominent inhibitory effect on 2D6 than some others in the class. Nevertheless, even sertraline has the potential for clinically important 2D6 inhibition. Consequently, concomitant use of a drug metabolized by P450 2D6 with sertraline hydrochloride may require lower doses than usually prescribed for the other drug. Furthermore, whenever sertraline hydrochloride is withdrawn from co-therapy, an increased dose of the co-administered drug may be required (see Tricyclic Antidepressant Drugs Effective in the Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder under PRECAUTIONS). Serotonergic Drugs: see CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . Triptans: There have been rare post marketing reports of serotonin syndrome with use of an SNRI or an SSRI and a triptan. If concomitant treatment of SNRIs and SSRIs, including sertraline hydrochloride, with a triptan is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases (see WARNINGS \u2013 Serotonin Syndrome). Sumatriptan \u2013There have been rare postmarketing reports describing patients with weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination following the use of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and sumatriptan. If concomitant treatment with sumatriptan and an SSRI (e.g., citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised. Tricyclic Antidepressant Drugs Effective in the Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (TCAs) \u2013The extent to which SSRI\u2013TCA interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved. Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the co-administration of TCAs with sertraline hydrochloride, because sertraline may inhibit TCA metabolism. Plasma TCA concentrations may need to be monitored, and the dose of TCA may need to be reduced, if a TCA is co-administered with sertraline hydrochloride (see Drugs Metabolized by P450 2D6 under PRECAUTIONS ). Hypoglycemic Drugs \u2013In a placebo-controlled trial in normal volunteers, administration of sertraline hydrochloride for 22 days (including 200 mg/day for the final 13 days) caused a statistically significant 16% decrease from baseline in the clearance of tolbutamide following an intravenous 1000 mg dose. Sertraline hydrochloride administration did not noticeably change either the plasma protein binding or the apparent volume of distribution of tolbutamide, suggesting that the decreased clearance was due to a change in the metabolism of the drug. The clinical significance of this decrease in tolbutamide clearance is unknown. Atenolol \u2013 Sertraline hydrochloride (100 mg) when administered to 10 healthy male subjects had no effect on the beta-adrenergic blocking ability of atenolol. Digoxin \u2013In a placebo-controlled trial in normal volunteers, administration of sertraline hydrochloride for 17 days (including 200 mg/day for the last 10 days) did not change serum digoxin levels or digoxin renal clearance. Microsomal Enzyme Induction \u2013Preclinical studies have shown sertraline hydrochloride to induce hepatic microsomal enzymes. In clinical studies, sertraline hydrochloride was shown to induce hepatic enzymes minimally as determined by a small (5%) but statistically significant decrease in antipyrine half-life following administration of 200 mg/day for 21 days. This small change in antipyrine half-life reflects a clinically insignificant change in hepatic metabolism. Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (Non-selective NSAIDs, Aspirin, Warfarin, etc.) Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Epidemiological studies of the case-control and cohort design that have demonstrated an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding have also shown that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin may potentiate this risk of bleeding. These studies have also shown that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin may potentiate this risk of bleeding. Altered anticoagulant effects, including increased bleeding, have been reported when SSRIs or SNRIs are coadministered with warfarin. Patients receiving warfarin therapy should be carefully monitored when Sertraline hydrochloride is initiated or discontinued. Electroconvulsive Therapy \u2013There are no clinical studies establishing the risks or benefits of the combined use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and Sertraline hydrochloride. Alcohol \u2013Although Sertraline hydrochloride did not potentiate the cognitive and psychomotor effects of alcohol in experiments with normal subjects, the concomitant use of sertraline hydrochloride and alcohol is not recommended. Carcinogenesis \u2013Lifetime carcinogenicity studies were carried out in CD-1 mice and Long-Evans rats at doses up to 40 mg/kg/day. These doses correspond to 1 times (mice) and 2 times (rats) the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) on a mg/m2 basis. There was a dose-related increase of liver adenomas in male mice receiving sertraline at 10-40 mg/kg (0.25-1.0 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). No increase was seen in female mice or in rats of either sex receiving the same treatments, nor was there an increase in hepatocellular carcinomas. Liver adenomas have a variable rate of spontaneous occurrence in the CD-1 mouse and are of unknown significance to humans. There was an increase in follicular adenomas of the thyroid in female rats receiving sertraline at 40 mg/kg (2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis); this was not accompanied by thyroid hyperplasia. While there was an increase in uterine adenocarcinomas in rats receiving sertraline at 10-40 mg/kg (0.5-2.0 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) compared to placebo controls, this effect was not clearly drug related. Mutagenesis \u2013Sertraline had no genotoxic effects, with or without metabolic activation, based on the following assays: bacterial mutation assay; mouse lymphoma mutation assay; and tests for cytogenetic aberrations in vivo in mouse bone marrow and in vitro in human lymphocytes. Impairment of Fertility \u2013A decrease in fertility was seen in one of two rat studies at a dose of 80 mg/kg (4 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis). Pregnancy\u2013Pregnancy Category C \u2013Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 80 mg/kg/day and 40 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses correspond to approximately 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) on a mg/m 2 basis. There was no evidence of teratogenicity at any dose level. When pregnant rats and rabbits were given sertraline during the period of organogenesis, delayed ossification was observed in fetuses at doses of 10 mg/kg (0.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) in rats and 40 mg/kg (4 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) in rabbits. When female rats received sertraline during the last third of gestation and throughout lactation, there was an increase in the number of stillborn pups and in the number of pups dying during the first 4 days after birth. Pup body weights were also decreased during the first four days after birth. These effects occurred at a dose of 20 mg/kg (1 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). The no effect dose for rat pup mortality was 10 mg/kg (0.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). The decrease in pup survival was shown to be due to in utero exposure to sertraline. The clinical significance of these effects is unknown. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Sertraline hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Pregnancy-Nonteratogenic Effects \u2013Neonates exposed to sertraline hydrochloride and other SSRIs or SNRIs, late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. These findings are based on postmarketing reports. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs and SNRIs or, possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome (see WARNINGS :Serotonin Syndrome). Infants exposed to SSRIs in pregnancy may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1 \u2013 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality. Several recent epidemiologic studies suggest a positive statistical association between SSRI use (including sertraline hydrochloride) in pregnancy and PPHN. Other studies do not show a significant statistical association. Physicians should also note the results of a prospective longitudinal study of 201 pregnant women with a history of major depression, who were either on antidepressants or had received antidepressants less than 12 weeks prior to their last menstrual period, and were in remission. Women who discontinued antidepressant medication during pregnancy showed a significant increase in relapse of their major depression compared to those women who remained on antidepressant medication throughout pregnancy. When treating a pregnant woman with sertraline hydrochloride, the physician should carefully consider both the potential risks of taking an SSRI, along with the established benefits of treating depression with an antidepressant. This decision can only be made on a case by case basis (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Labor and Delivery \u2013The effect of sertraline hydrochloride on labor and delivery in humans is unknown. Nursing Mothers \u2013It is not known whether, and if so in what amount, sertraline or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when sertraline hydrochloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use \u2013 The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder was demonstrated in a 12-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled study with 187 outpatients ages 6-17 (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population other than pediatric patients with OCD have not been established (see BOX WARNING and WARNINGS -Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk). Two placebo controlled trials (n=373) in pediatric patients with MDD have been conducted with sertraline hydrochloride, and the data were not sufficient to support a claim for use in pediatric patients. Anyone considering the use of Sertraline hydrochloride in a child or adolescent must balance the potential risks with the clinical need. The safety of Sertraline hydrochloride use in children and adolescents with OCD, ages 6-18, was evaluated in a 12-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled study with 187 outpatients, ages 6-17, and in a flexible dose, 52 week open extension study of 137 patients, ages 6-18, who had completed the initial 12week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Sertraline hydrochloride was administered at doses of either 25 mg/day (children, ages 6-12) or 50 mg/day (adolescents, ages 13-18) and then titrated in weekly 25 mg/day or 50 mg/day increments, respectively, to a maximum dose of 200 mg/day based upon clinical response. The mean dose for completers was 157 mg/day. In the acute 12 week pediatric study and in the 52 week study, Sertraline hydrochloride had an adverse event profile generally similar to that observed in adults. Sertraline pharmacokinetics were evaluated in 61 pediatric patients between 6 and 17 years of age with major depressive disorder or OCD and revealed similar drug exposures to those of adults when plasma concentration was adjusted for weight (see Pharmacokinetics under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Approximately 600 patients with major depressive disorder or OCD between 6 and 17 years of age have received Sertraline hydrochloride in clinical trials, both controlled and uncontrolled. The adverse event profile observed in these patients was generally similar to that observed in adult studies with sertraline hydrochloride (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). As with other SSRIs, decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of Sertraline hydrochloride. In a pooled analysis of two 10-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible dose (50-200 mg) outpatient trials for major depressive disorder (n=373), there was a difference in weight change between sertraline and placebo of roughly 1 kilogram, for both children (ages 6-11) and adolescents (ages 12-17), in both cases representing a slight weight loss for sertraline compared to a slight gain for placebo. At baseline the mean weight for children was 39.0 kg for sertraline and 38.5 kg for placebo. At baseline the mean weight for adolescents was 61.4 kg for sertraline and 62.5 kg for placebo. There was a bigger difference between sertraline and placebo in the proportion of outliers for clinically important weight loss in children than in adolescents. For children, about 7% had a weight loss > 7% of body weight compared to none of the placebo patients; for adolescents, about 2% had a weight loss > 7% of body weight compared to about 1% of the placebo patients. A subset of these patients who completed the randomized controlled trials (sertraline n=99, placebo n=122) were continued into a 24-week, flexible-dose, open-label, extension study. A mean weight loss of approximately 0.5 kg was seen during the first eight weeks of treatment for subjects with first exposure to sertraline during the open-label extension study, similar to mean weight loss observed among sertraline treated subjects during the first eight weeks of the randomized controlled trials. The subjects continuing in the open label study began gaining weight compared to baseline by week 12 of sertraline treatment. Those subjects who completed 34 weeks of sertraline treatment (10 weeks in a placebo controlled trial + 24 weeks open label, n=68) had weight gain that was similar to that expected using data from age-adjusted peers. Regular monitoring of weight and growth is recommended if treatment of a pediatric patient with an SSRI is to be continued long term. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 6 have not been established. The risks, if any, that may be associated with Sertraline hydrochloride's use beyond 1 year in children and adolescents with OCD or major depressive disorder have not been systematically assessed. The prescriber should be mindful that the evidence relied upon to conclude that sertraline is safe for use in children and adolescents derives from clinical studies that were 10 to 52 weeks in duration and from the extrapolation of experience gained with adult patients. In particular, there are no studies that directly evaluate the effects of long-term sertraline use on the growth, development, and maturation of children and adolescents. Although there is no affirmative finding to suggest that sertraline possesses a capacity to adversely affect growth, development or maturation, the absence of such findings is not compelling evidence of the absence of the potential of sertraline to have adverse effects in chronic use (see WARNINGS \u2013 Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk). Geriatric Use \u2013U.S. geriatric clinical studies of Sertraline hydrochloride in major depressive disorder included 663 Sertraline hydrochloride -treated subjects \u2265 65 years of age, of those, 180 were \u2265 75 years of age. No overall differences in the pattern of adverse reactions were observed in the geriatric clinical trial subjects relative to those reported in younger subjects (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ), and other reported experience has not identified differences in safety patterns between the elderly and younger subjects. As with all medications, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. There were 947 subjects in placebo-controlled geriatric clinical studies of Sertraline hydrochloride in major depressive disorder. No overall differences in the pattern of efficacy were observed in the geriatric clinical trial subjects relative to those reported in younger subjects. Other Adverse Events in Geriatric Patients. In 354 geriatric subjects treated with Sertraline hydrochloride in placebo-controlled trials, the overall profile of adverse events was generally similar to that shown in Tables 2 and 3. Urinary tract infection was the only adverse event not appearing in Tables 2 and 3 and reported at an incidence of at least 2% and at a rate greater than placebo in placebo-controlled trials. SSRIS and SNRIs, including Sertraline hydrochloride, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse event (see PRECAUTIONS , Hyponatremia)."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS During its premarketing assessment, multiple doses of sertraline hydrochloride were administered to over 4000 adult subjects as of February 18, 2000. The conditions and duration of exposure to sertraline hydrochloride varied greatly, and included (in overlapping categories) clinical pharmacology studies, open and double-blind studies, uncontrolled and controlled studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, fixed-dose and titration studies, and studies for multiple indications, including major depressive disorder and PMDD. Untoward events associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tabulations that follow, a World Health Organization dictionary of terminology has been used to classify reported adverse events. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportion of the over 4000 adult individuals exposed to multiple doses of sertraline hydrochloride who experienced a treatment-emergent adverse event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving sertraline hydrochloride. An event was considered treatment-emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. It is important to emphasize that events reported during therapy were not necessarily caused by it. The prescriber should be aware that the figures in the tables and tabulations cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the side effect incidence rate in the population studied. Incidence in Placebo-Controlled Trials \u2013 Table 2 enumerates the most common treatment-emergent adverse events associated with the use of Sertraline hydrochloride (incidence of at least 5% for Sertraline hydrochloride and at least twice that for placebo within at least one of the indications) for the treatment of adult patients with major depressive disorder/other*, OCD, panic disorder, PTSD, PMDD and social anxiety disorder in placebo-controlled clinical trials. Most patients in major depressive disorder/other*, OCD, panic disorder, PTSD and social anxiety disorder studies received doses of 50 to 200 mg/day. Patients in the PMDD study with daily dosing throughout the menstrual cycle received doses of 50 to 150 mg/day, and in the PMDD study with dosing during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle received doses of 50 to 100 mg/day. Table 3 enumerates treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in 2% or more of adult patients treated with Sertraline hydrochloride and with incidence greater than placebo who participated in controlled clinical trials comparing Sertraline hydrochloride with placebo in the treatment of major depressive disorder/other*, OCD, panic disorder, PTSD, PMDD and social anxiety disorder. Table 3 provides combined data for the pool of studies that are provided separately by indication in Table 2.

In particular, some evidence suggests that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can cause such untoward sexual experiences. Reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of untoward experiences involving sexual desire, performance and satisfaction are difficult to obtain, however, in part because patients and physicians may be reluctant to discuss them. Accordingly, estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance cited in product labeling, are likely to underestimate their actual incidence. Table 5 below displays the incidence of sexual side effects reported by at least 2% of patients taking Sertraline hydrochloride in placebo-controlled trials. TABLE 5 *Denominator used was for male patients only (N=1118 Sertraline hydrochloride; N=926 placebo) **Denominator used was for male and female patients (N=2799 Sertraline hydrochloride; N=2394 placebo) Adverse Event Sertraline Placebo Ejaculation failure*(primarily delayed ejaculation) 14% 1% Decreased libido** 6% 1% There are no adequate and well-controlled studies examining sexual dysfunction with sertraline treatment. Priapism has been reported with all SSRIs. While it is difficult to know the precise risk of sexual dysfunction associated with the use of SSRIs, physicians should routinely inquire about such possible side effects. Other Adverse Events in Pediatric Patients \u2013In over 600 pediatric patients treated with Sertraline hydrochloride, the overall profile of adverse events was generally similar to that seen in adult studies. However, the following adverse events, from controlled trials, not appearing in Tables 2 and 3, were reported at an incidence of at least 2% and occurred at a rate of at least twice the placebo rate (N=281 patients treated with Sertraline hydrochloride): fever, hyperkinesia, urinary incontinence, aggressive reaction, sinusitis, epistaxis and purpura. Other Events Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Sertraline hydrochloride \u2013Following is a list of treatment-emergent adverse events reported during premarketing assessment of Sertraline hydrochloride in clinical trials (over 4000 adult subjects) except those already listed in the previous tables or elsewhere in labeling. In the tabulations that follow, a World Health Organization dictionary of terminology has been used to classify reported adverse events. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportion of the over 4000 adult individuals exposed to multiple doses of Sertraline hydrochloride who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving Sertraline hydrochloride. All events are included except those already listed in the previous tables or elsewhere in labeling and those reported in terms so general as to be uninformative and those for which a causal relationship to Sertraline hydrochloride treatment seemed remote. It is important to emphasize that although the events reported occurred during treatment with Sertraline hydrochloride, they were not necessarily caused by it. Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients. Events of major clinical importance are also described in the PRECAUTIONS section. Autonomic Nervous System Disorders \u2013 Frequent: impotence; Infrequent: flushing, increased saliva, cold clammy skin, mydriasis; Rare: pallor, glaucoma, priapism, vasodilation.

Laboratory Tests \u2013In man, asymptomatic elevations in serum transaminases (SGOT [or AST] and SGPT [or ALT]) have been reported infrequently (approximately 0.8%) in association with sertraline hydrochloride administration. These hepatic enzyme elevations usually occurred within the first 1 to 9 weeks of drug treatment and promptly diminished upon drug discontinuation. Sertraline hydrochloride therapy was associated with small mean increases in total cholesterol (approximately 3%) and triglycerides (approximately 5%), and a small mean decrease in serum uric acid (approximately 7%) of no apparent clinical importance. The safety profile observed with Sertraline hydrochloride treatment in patients with major depressive disorder, OCD, panic disorder, PTSD, PMDD and social anxiety disorder is similar. Other Events Observed During the Postmarketing Evaluation of Sertraline hydrochloride \u2013Reports of adverse events temporally associated with Sertraline hydrochloride that have been received since market introduction, that are not listed above and that may have no causal relationship with the drug, include the following: acute renal failure, anaphylactoid reaction, angioedema, blindness, optic neuritis, cataract, increased coagulation times, bradycardia, AV block, atrial arrhythmias, QT-interval prolongation, ventricular tachycardia (including torsade de pointes-type arrhythmias), hypothyroidism, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia and pancytopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, lupus-like syndrome, serum sickness, hyperglycemia, galactorrhea, hyperprolactinemia, extrapyramidal symptoms, oculogyric crisis, psychosis, pulmonary hypertension, severe skin reactions, which potentially can be fatal, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, vasculitis, photosensitivity and other severe cutaneous disorders, rare reports of pancreatitis, and liver events\u2014clinical features (which in the majority of cases appeared to be reversible with discontinuation of sertraline hydrochloride) occurring in one or more patients include: elevated enzymes, increased bilirubin, hepatomegaly, hepatitis, jaundice, abdominal pain, vomiting, liver failure and death."

        "DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Controlled Substance Class \u2013 Sertraline hydrochloride is not a controlled substance. Physical and Psychological Dependence \u2013In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study of the comparative abuse liability of Sertraline hydrochloride, alprazolam, and d-amphetamine in humans, Sertraline hydrochloride did not produce the positive subjective effects indicative of abuse potential, such as euphoria or drug liking, that were observed with the other two drugs. Premarketing clinical experience with Sertraline hydrochloride did not reveal any tendency for a withdrawal syndrome or any drug-seeking behavior. In animal studies sertraline hydrochloride does not demonstrate stimulant or barbiturate-like (depressant) abuse potential. As with any CNS active drug, however, physicians should carefully evaluate patients for history of drug abuse and follow such patients closely, observing them for signs of sertraline hydrochloride misuse or abuse (e.g., development of tolerance, incrementation of dose, drug-seeking behavior)."

      "overdosage": [
        "OVERDOSAGE Human Experience \u2013 Of 1,027 cases of overdose involving sertraline hydrochloride worldwide, alone or with other drugs, there were 72 deaths (circa 1999). Among 634 overdoses in which sertraline hydrochloride was the only drug ingested, 8 resulted in fatal outcome, 75 completely recovered, and 27 patients experienced sequelae after overdosage to include alopecia, decreased libido, diarrhea, ejaculation disorder, fatigue, insomnia, somnolence and serotonin syndrome. The remaining 524 cases had an unknown outcome. The most common signs and symptoms associated with non-fatal sertraline hydrochloride overdosage were somnolence, vomiting, tachycardia, nausea, dizziness, agitation and tremor. The largest known ingestion was 13.5 grams in a patient who took sertraline hydrochloride alone and subsequently recovered. However, another patient who took 2.5 grams of sertraline hydrochloride alone experienced a fatal outcome. Other important adverse events reported with sertraline hydrochloride overdose (single or multiple drugs) include bradycardia, bundle branch block, coma, convulsions, delirium, hallucinations, hypertension, hypotension, manic reaction, pancreatitis, QT-interval prolongation, serotonin syndrome, stupor and syncope. Overdose Management \u2013Treatment should consist of those general measures employed in the management of overdosage with any antidepressant. Ensure an adequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation. Monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs. General supportive and symptomatic measures are also recommended. Induction of emesis is not recommended. Gastric lavage with a large-bore orogastric tube with appropriate airway protection, if needed, may be indicated if performed soon after ingestion, or in symptomatic patients. Activated charcoal should be administered. Due to large volume of distribution of this drug, forced diuresis, dialysis, hemoperfusion and exchange transfusion are unlikely to be of benefit. No specific antidotes for sertraline are known. In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug involvement. The physician should consider contacting a poison control center on the treatment of any overdose. Telephone numbers for certified poison control centers are listed in the Physicians' Desk Reference \u00ae (PDR\u00ae)."

      "dosage_and_administration": [
        "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Initial Treatment Dosage for Adults Major Depressive Disorder \u2013Sertraline hydrochloride treatment should be administered at a dose of 50 mg once daily. While a relationship between dose and effect has not been established for major depressive disorder, OCD, panic disorder, PTSD or social anxiety disorder, patients were dosed in a range of 50-200 mg/day in the clinical trials demonstrating the effectiveness of Sertraline hydrochloride for the treatment of this indication. Consequently, a dose of 50 mg, administered once daily, is recommended as the initial therapeutic dose. Patients not responding to a 50 mg dose may benefit from dose increases up to a maximum of 200 mg/day. Given the 24 hour elimination half-life of sertraline hydrochloride, dose changes should not occur at intervals of less than 1 week. Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder \u2013 Sertraline hydrochloride treatment should be initiated with a dose of 50 mg/day, either daily throughout the menstrual cycle or limited to the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, depending on physician assessment. While a relationship between dose and effect has not been established for PMDD, patients were dosed in the range of 50-150 mg/day with dose increases at the onset of each new menstrual cycle (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Patients not responding to a 50 mg/day dose may benefit from dose increases (at 50 mg increments/ menstrual cycle) up to 150 mg/day when dosing daily throughout the menstrual cycle, or 100 mg/day when dosing during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. If a 100 mg/day dose has been established with luteal phase dosing, a 50 mg/day titration step for three days should be utilized at the beginning of each luteal phase dosing period. Sertraline hydrochloride should be administered once daily, either in the morning or evening. Dosage for Pediatric Population (Children and Adolescents) Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder \u2013 Sertraline hydrochloride treatment should be initiated with a dose of 25 mg once daily in children (ages 6-12) and at a dose of 50 mg once daily in adolescents (ages 13-17). While a relationship between dose and effect has not been established for OCD, patients were dosed in a range of 25-200 mg/day in the clinical trials demonstrating the effectiveness of Sertraline hydrochloride for pediatric patients (6-17 years) with OCD. Patients not responding to an initial dose of 25 or 50 mg/day may benefit from dose increases up to a maximum of 200 mg/day. For children with OCD, their generally lower body weights compared to adults should be taken into consideration in advancing the dose, in order to avoid excess dosing. Given the 24 hour elimination half-life of Sertraline hydrochloride, dose changes should not occur at intervals of less than 1 week. Sertraline hydrochloride should be administered once daily, either in the morning or evening. Maintenance/Continuation/Extended Treatment Major Depressive Disorder \u2013It is generally agreed that acute episodes of major depressive disorder require several months or longer of sustained pharmacologic therapy beyond response to the acute episode. Systematic evaluation of sertraline hydrochloride has demonstrated that its antidepressant efficacy is maintained for periods of up to 44 weeks following 8 weeks of initial treatment at a dose of 50-200 mg/day (mean dose of 70 mg/day) (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). It is not known whether the dose of sertraline hydrochloride needed for maintenance treatment is identical to the dose needed to achieve an initial response. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder \u2013It is generally agreed that PTSD requires several months or longer of sustained pharmacological therapy beyond response to initial treatment. Systematic evaluation of Sertraline hydrochloride has demonstrated that its efficacy in PTSD is maintained for periods of up to 28 weeks following 24 weeks of treatment at a dose of 50-200 mg/day (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). It is not known whether the dose of Sertraline hydrochloride needed for maintenance treatment is identical to the dose needed to achieve an initial response. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment. Social Anxiety Disorder \u2013Social anxiety disorder is a chronic condition that may require several months or longer of sustained pharmacological therapy beyond response to initial treatment. Systematic evaluation of Sertraline hydrochloride has demonstrated that its efficacy in social anxiety disorder is maintained for periods of up to 24 weeks following 20 weeks of treatment at a dose of 50-200 mg/day (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Dosage adjustments should be made to maintain patients on the lowest effective dose and patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for long-term treatment. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and Panic Disorder \u2013It is generally agreed that OCD and Panic Disorder require several months or longer of sustained pharmacological therapy beyond response to initial treatment. Systematic evaluation of continuing Sertraline hydrochloride for periods of up to 28 weeks in patients with OCD and Panic Disorder who have responded while taking Sertraline hydrochloride during initial treatment phases of 24 to 52 weeks of treatment at a dose range of 50-200 mg/day has demonstrated a benefit of such maintenance treatment (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). It is not known whether the dose of Sertraline hydrochloride needed for maintenance treatment is identical to the dose needed to achieve an initial response. Nevertheless, patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment. Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder \u2013The effectiveness of sertraline hydrochloride in long-term use, that is, for more than 3 menstrual cycles, has not been systematically evaluated in controlled trials. However, as women commonly report that symptoms worsen with age until relieved by the onset of menopause, it is reasonable to consider continuation of a responding patient. Dosage adjustments, which may include changes between dosage regimens (e.g., daily throughout the menstrual cycle versus during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle), may be needed to maintain the patient on the lowest effective dosage and patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for continued treatment. Switching a Patient To or From a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Intended to Treat Psychiatric Disorders: At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders and initiation of therapy with Sertraline hydrochloride. Conversely, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping Sertraline hydrochloride before starting an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Use of Sertraline Hydrochloride With Other MAOIs Such as Linezolid or Methylene Blue: Do not start Sertraline hydrochloride in a patient who is being treated with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue because there is increased risk of serotonin syndrome. In a patient who requires more urgent treatment of a psychiatric condition, other interventions, including hospitalization, should be considered (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). In some cases, a patient already receiving Sertraline hydrochloride therapy may require urgent treatment with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. If acceptable alternatives to linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are not available and the potential benefits of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are judged to outweigh the risks of serotonin syndrome in a particular patient, Sertraline hydrochloride should be stopped promptly, and linezolid or intravenous methylene blue can be administered. The patient should be monitored for symptoms of serotonin syndrome for 2 weeks or until 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue, whichever comes first. Therapy with Sertraline hydrochloride may be resumed 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue (see WARNINGS ). The risk of administering methylene blue by non-intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg/kg with Sertraline hydrochloride is unclear. The clinician should, nevertheless, be aware of the possibility of emergent symptoms of serotonin syndrome with such use (see WARNINGS ). Special Populations Dosage for Hepatically Impaired Patients \u2013The use of sertraline in patients with liver disease should be approached with caution. The effects of sertraline in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment have not been studied. If sertraline is administered to patients with liver impairment, a lower or less frequent dose should be used (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and PRECAUTIONS ). Treatment of Pregnant Women During the Third Trimester \u2013Neonates exposed to Sertraline hydrochloride and other SSRIs or SNRIs, late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding (see PRECAUTIONS ). When treating pregnant women with Sertraline hydrochloride during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of treatment. Discontinuation of Treatment with Sertraline hydrochloride Symptoms associated with discontinuation of Sertraline hydrochloride and other SSRIs and SNRIs, have been reported (see PRECAUTIONS ). Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate."

      "clinical_pharmacology": [
        "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The therapeutic benefits achieved with diltiazem are believed to be related to its ability to inhibit the influx of calcium ions during membrane depolarization of cardiac and vascular smooth muscle. Mechanisms of Action Although precise mechanisms of its antianginal actions are still being delineated, diltiazem is believed to act in the following ways: Angina Due to Coronary Artery Spasm: Diltiazem has been shown to be a potent dilator of coronary arteries both epicardial and subendocardial. Spontaneous and ergonovine-induced coronary artery spasms are inhibited by diltiazem. Exertional Angina: Diltiazem has been shown to produce increases in exercise tolerance, probably due to its ability to reduce myocardial oxygen demand. This is accomplished via reductions in heart rate and systemic blood pressure at submaximal and maximal exercise workloads. In animal models, diltiazem interferes with the slow inward (depolarizing) current in excitable tissue. It causes excitation-contraction uncoupling in various myocardial tissues without changes in the configuration of the action potential. Diltiazem produces relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle and dilation of both large and small coronary arteries at drug levels which cause little or no negative inotropic effect. The resultant increases in coronary blood flow (epicardial and subendocardial) occur in ischemic and nonischemic models and are accompanied by dose-dependent decreases in systemic blood pressure and decreases in peripheral resistance. Hemodynamic and Electrophysiologic Effects Like other calcium antagonists, diltiazem decreases sinoatrial and atrioventricular conduction in isolated tissues and has a negative inotropic effect in isolated preparations. In the intact animal, prolongation of the AH interval can be seen at higher doses. In man, diltiazem prevents spontaneous and ergonovine-provoked coronary artery spasm. It causes a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance and a modest fall in blood pressure, and in exercise tolerance studies in patients with ischemic heart disease, reduces the heart rate-blood pressure product for any given workload. Studies to date, primarily in patients with good ventricular function, have not revealed evidence of a negative inotropic effect; cardiac output, ejection fraction, and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure have not been affected. There are as yet few data on the interaction of diltiazem and beta-blockers. Resting heart rate is usually unchanged or slightly reduced by diltiazem. Intravenous diltiazem in doses of 20 mg prolongs AH conduction time and AV node functional and effective refractory periods approximately 20%. In a study involving single oral doses of 300 mg of diltiazem in six normal volunteers, the average maximum PR prolongation was 14% with no instances of greater than first-degree AV block. Diltiazem-associated prolongation of the AH interval is not more pronounced in patients with first-degree heart block. In patients with sick sinus syndrome, diltiazem significantly prolongs sinus cycle length (up to 50% in some cases). Chronic oral administration of diltiazem in doses of up to 240 mg/day has resulted in small increases in PR interval but has not usually produced abnormal prolongation. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Diltiazem is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is subject to an extensive first-pass effect, giving an absolute bioavailability (compared to intravenous dosing) of about 40%. Diltiazem undergoes extensive metabolism in which 2% to 4% of the unchanged drug appears in the urine. In vitro binding studies show diltiazem is 70% to 80% bound to plasma proteins. Competitive in vitro ligand binding studies have also shown diltiazem binding is not altered by therapeutic concentrations of digoxin, hydrochlorothiazide, phenylbutazone, propranolol, salicylic acid, or warfarin. The plasma elimination half-life following single or multiple drug administration is approximately 3.0 to 4.5 hours. Desacetyl diltiazem is also present in the plasma at levels of 10% to 20% of the parent drug and is 25% to 50% as potent as a coronary vasodilator as diltiazem. Minimum therapeutic plasma levels of diltiazem appear to be in the range of 50 to 200 ng/mL. There is a departure from linearity when dose strengths are increased. A study that compared patients with normal hepatic function to patients with cirrhosis found an increase in half-life and a 69% increase in AUC (area-under-the-plasma concentration vs. time curve) in the hepatically impaired patients. A single study in nine patients with severely impaired renal functions showed no difference in the pharmacokinetic profile of diltiazem as compared to patients with normal renal function. Diltiazem Tablets: Diltiazem is absorbed from the tablet formulation to about 98% of a reference solution. Single oral doses of 30 to 120 mg of diltiazem tablets result in detectable plasma levels within 30 to 60 minutes and peak plasma levels 2 to 4 hours after drug administration. As the dose of diltiazem tablets is increased from a daily dose of 120 mg (30 mg qid) to 240 mg (60 mg qid) daily, there is an increase in area-under-the-curve of 2.3 times. When the dose is increased from 240 mg to 360 mg daily, there is an increase in area-under-the-curve of 1.8 times."

      ],
      "warnings": [
        "WARNINGS 1. Cardiac Conduction: Diltiazem prolongs AV node refractory periods without significantly prolonging sinus node recovery time, except in patients with sick sinus syndrome. This effect may rarely result in abnormally slow heart rates (particularly in patients with sick sinus syndrome) or second- or third-degree AV block (six of 1243 patients for 0.48%). Concomitant use of diltiazem with beta-blockers or digitalis may result in additive effects on cardiac conduction. A patient with Prinzmetal's angina developed periods of asystole (2 to 5 seconds) after a single dose of 60 mg of diltiazem (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). 2. Congestive Heart Failure: Although diltiazem has a negative inotropic effect in isolated animal tissue preparations, hemodynamic studies in humans with normal ventricular function have not shown a reduction in cardiac index nor consistent negative effects on contractility (dP/dt). Experience with the use of diltiazem alone or in combination with beta-blockers in patients with impaired ventricular function is very limited. Caution should be exercised when using the drug in such patients. 3. Hypotension: Decreases in blood pressure associated with diltiazem therapy may occasionally result in symptomatic hypotension. 4. Acute Hepatic Injury: In rare instances, significant elevations in enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase, LDH, SGOT, SGPT, and other phenomena consistent with acute hepatic injury have been noted. These reactions have been reversible upon discontinuation of drug therapy. The relationship to diltiazem is uncertain in most cases, but probable in some (see PRECAUTIONS )."
      ],
      "precautions": [
        "PRECAUTIONS General Diltiazem is extensively metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys and in bile. As with any drug given over prolonged periods, laboratory parameters of renal and hepatic function should be monitored at regular intervals. The drug should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. In subacute and chronic dog and rat studies designed to produce toxicity, high doses of diltiazem were associated with hepatic damage. In special subacute hepatic studies, oral doses of 125 mg/kg and higher in rats were associated with histological changes in the liver, which were reversible when the drug was discontinued. In dogs, doses of 20 mg/kg were also associated with hepatic changes; however, these changes were reversible with continued dosing. Dermatological events (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ) may be transient and may disappear despite continued use of diltiazem. However, skin eruptions progressing to erythema multiforme and/or exfoliative dermatitis have also been infrequently reported. Should a dermatologic reaction persist, the drug should be discontinued. Drug Interactions Due to the potential for additive effects, caution and careful titration are warranted in patients receiving diltiazem concomitantly with any agents known to affect cardiac contractility and/or conduction (see WARNINGS ). Pharmacologic studies indicate that there may be additive effects in prolonging AV conduction when using beta-blockers or digitalis concomitantly with diltiazem (see WARNINGS ). As with all drugs, care should be exercised when treating patients with multiple medications. Diltiazem is both a substrate and an inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system. Other drugs that are specific substrates, inhibitors, or inducers of this enzyme system may have a significant impact on the efficacy and side effect profile of diltiazem. Patients taking other drugs that are substrates of CYP450 3A4, especially patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment, may require dosage adjustment when starting or stopping concomitantly administered diltiazem in order to maintain optimum therapeutic blood levels. Anesthetics: The depression of cardiac contractility, conductivity, and automaticity, as well as the vascular dilation associated with anesthetics, may be potentiated by calcium channel blockers. When used concomitantly, anesthetics and calcium blockers should be titrated carefully. Benzodiazepines: Studies showed that diltiazem increased the AUC of midazolam and triazolam by 3- to 4-fold and the C max by 2-fold, compared to placebo. The elimination half-life of midazolam and triazolam also increased (1.5- to 2.5-fold) during coadministration with diltiazem. These pharmacokinetic effects seen during diltiazem coadministration can result in increased clinical effects (e.g., prolonged sedation) of both midazolam and triazolam. Beta-blockers: Controlled and uncontrolled domestic studies suggest that concomitant use of diltiazem and beta-blockers is usually well tolerated. Available data are not sufficient, however, to predict the effects of concomitant treatment, particularly in patients with left ventricular dysfunction or cardiac conduction abnormalities. Administration of diltiazem concomitantly with propranolol in five normal volunteers resulted in increased propranolol levels in all subjects, and bioavailability of propranolol was increased approximately 50%. In vitro , propranolol appears to be displaced from its binding sites by diltiazem. If combination therapy is initiated or withdrawn in conjunction with propranolol, an adjustment in the propranolol dose may be warranted (see WARNINGS ). Buspirone: In nine healthy subjects, diltiazem significantly increased the mean buspirone AUC 5.5-fold and C max 4.1-fold compared to placebo. The T 1/2 and T max of buspirone were not significantly affected by diltiazem. Enhanced effects and increased toxicity of buspirone may be possible during concomitant administration with diltiazem. Subsequent dose adjustments may be necessary during coadministration, and should be based on clinical assessment. Carbamazepine: Concomitant administration of diltiazem with carbamazepine has been reported to result in elevated serum levels of carbamazepine (40% to 72% increase) resulting in toxicity in some cases. Patients receiving these drugs concurrently should be monitored for a potential drug interaction. Cimetidine: A study in six healthy volunteers has shown a significant increase in peak diltiazem plasma levels (58%) and area-under-the-curve (53%) after a 1-week course of cimetidine at 1200 mg per day and a single dose of diltiazem 60 mg. Ranitidine produced smaller, nonsignificant increases. The effect may be mediated by cimetidine's known inhibition of hepatic cytochrome P450, the enzyme system responsible for the first-pass metabolism of diltiazem. Patients currently receiving diltiazem therapy should be carefully monitored for a change in pharmacological effect when initiating and discontinuing therapy with cimetidine. An adjustment in the diltiazem dose may be warranted. Clonidine: Sinus bradycardia resulting in hospitalization and pacemaker insertion has been reported in association with the use of clonidine concurrently with diltiazem. Monitor heart rate in patients receiving concomitant diltiazem and clonidine. Cyclosporine: A pharmacokinetic interaction between diltiazem and cyclosporine has been observed during studies involving renal and cardiac transplant patients. In renal and cardiac transplant recipients, a reduction of cyclosporine trough dose ranging from 15% to 48% was necessary to maintain concentrations similar to those seen prior to the addition of diltiazem. If these agents are to be administered concurrently, cyclosporine concentrations should be monitored, especially when diltiazem therapy is initiated, adjusted, or discontinued. The effect of cyclosporine on diltiazem plasma concentrations has not been evaluated. Digitalis: Administration of diltiazem with digoxin in 24 healthy male subjects increased plasma digoxin concentrations approximately 20%. Another investigator found no increase in digoxin levels in 12 patients with coronary artery disease. Since there have been conflicting results regarding the effect of digoxin levels, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing diltiazem therapy to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization (see WARNINGS ). Ivabradine: Concurrent use of diltiazem increases exposure to ivabradine and may exacerbate bradycardia and conduction disturbances. Avoid concomitant use of ivabradine and diltiazem. Quinidine: Diltiazem significantly increases the AUC (0\u2192\u221e) of quinidine by 51%, T 1/2 by 36%, and decreases its CL oral by 33%. Monitoring for quinidine adverse effects may be warranted and the dose adjusted accordingly. Rifampin: Coadministration of rifampin with diltiazem lowered the diltiazem plasma concentrations to undetectable levels. Coadministration of diltiazem with rifampin or any known CYP3A4 inducer should be avoided when possible, and alternative therapy considered. Statins: Diltiazem is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and has been shown to increase significantly the AUC of some statins. The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with statins metabolized by CYP3A4 may be increased with concomitant use of diltiazem. When possible, use a non-CYP3A4-metabolized statin together with diltiazem; otherwise, dose adjustments for both diltiazem and the statin should be considered along with close monitoring for signs and symptoms of any statin-related adverse events. In a healthy volunteer crossover study (N=10), coadministration of a single 20 mg dose of simvastatin at the end of a 14-day regimen with 120 mg BID diltiazem SR resulted in a 5-fold increase in mean simvastatin AUC versus simvastatin alone. Subjects with increased average steady-state exposures of diltiazem showed a greater fold increase in simvastatin exposure. Computer-based simulations showed that at a daily dose of 480 mg of diltiazem, an 8- to 9-fold mean increase in simvastatin AUC can be expected. If coadministration of simvastatin with diltiazem is required, limit the daily doses of simvastatin to 10 mg and diltiazem to 240 mg. In a ten-subject randomized, open label, 4-way crossover study, coadministration of diltiazem (120 mg BID diltiazem SR for 2 weeks) with a single 20 mg dose of lovastatin resulted in 3- to 4-fold increase in mean lovastatin AUC and C max versus lovastatin alone. In the same study, there was no significant change in 20 mg single dose pravastatin AUC and C max during diltiazem coadministration. Diltiazem plasma levels were not significantly affected by lovastatin or pravastatin. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats and a 21-month study in mice showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. There was also no mutagenic response in in vitro bacterial tests. No intrinsic effect on fertility was observed in rats. Pregnancy Reproduction studies have been conducted in mice, rats, and rabbits. Administration of doses ranging from five to ten times greater (on a mg/kg basis) than the daily recommended therapeutic dose has resulted in embryo and fetal lethality. These doses, in some studies, have been reported to cause skeletal abnormalities. In the perinatal/postnatal studies, there was some reduction in early individual pup weights and survival rates. There was an increased incidence of stillbirths at doses of 20 times the human dose or greater. There are no well-controlled studies in pregnant women; therefore, use diltiazem in pregnant women only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers Diltiazem is excreted in human milk. One report suggests that concentrations in breast milk may approximate serum levels. If use of diltiazem is deemed essential, an alternative method of infant feeding should be instituted. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of diltiazem did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Information for Patients 30 mg \u2013 Diltiazem tablets may be swallowed whole, crushed, or chewed. Do not split diltiazem tablets. 60 mg, 90 mg, and 120 mg \u2013 Diltiazem tablets may be swallowed whole, crushed, or chewed."

      "general_precautions": [
        "General Diltiazem is extensively metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys and in bile. As with any drug given over prolonged periods, laboratory parameters of renal and hepatic function should be monitored at regular intervals. The drug should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. In subacute and chronic dog and rat studies designed to produce toxicity, high doses of diltiazem were associated with hepatic damage. In special subacute hepatic studies, oral doses of 125 mg/kg and higher in rats were associated with histological changes in the liver, which were reversible when the drug was discontinued. In dogs, doses of 20 mg/kg were also associated with hepatic changes; however, these changes were reversible with continued dosing. Dermatological events (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ) may be transient and may disappear despite continued use of diltiazem. However, skin eruptions progressing to erythema multiforme and/or exfoliative dermatitis have also been infrequently reported. Should a dermatologic reaction persist, the drug should be discontinued."
      ],
      "drug_interactions": [
        "Drug Interactions Due to the potential for additive effects, caution and careful titration are warranted in patients receiving diltiazem concomitantly with any agents known to affect cardiac contractility and/or conduction (see WARNINGS ). Pharmacologic studies indicate that there may be additive effects in prolonging AV conduction when using beta-blockers or digitalis concomitantly with diltiazem (see WARNINGS ). As with all drugs, care should be exercised when treating patients with multiple medications. Diltiazem is both a substrate and an inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system. Other drugs that are specific substrates, inhibitors, or inducers of this enzyme system may have a significant impact on the efficacy and side effect profile of diltiazem. Patients taking other drugs that are substrates of CYP450 3A4, especially patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment, may require dosage adjustment when starting or stopping concomitantly administered diltiazem in order to maintain optimum therapeutic blood levels. Anesthetics: The depression of cardiac contractility, conductivity, and automaticity, as well as the vascular dilation associated with anesthetics, may be potentiated by calcium channel blockers. When used concomitantly, anesthetics and calcium blockers should be titrated carefully. Benzodiazepines: Studies showed that diltiazem increased the AUC of midazolam and triazolam by 3- to 4-fold and the C max by 2-fold, compared to placebo. The elimination half-life of midazolam and triazolam also increased (1.5- to 2.5-fold) during coadministration with diltiazem. These pharmacokinetic effects seen during diltiazem coadministration can result in increased clinical effects (e.g., prolonged sedation) of both midazolam and triazolam. Beta-blockers: Controlled and uncontrolled domestic studies suggest that concomitant use of diltiazem and beta-blockers is usually well tolerated. Available data are not sufficient, however, to predict the effects of concomitant treatment, particularly in patients with left ventricular dysfunction or cardiac conduction abnormalities. Administration of diltiazem concomitantly with propranolol in five normal volunteers resulted in increased propranolol levels in all subjects, and bioavailability of propranolol was increased approximately 50%. In vitro , propranolol appears to be displaced from its binding sites by diltiazem. If combination therapy is initiated or withdrawn in conjunction with propranolol, an adjustment in the propranolol dose may be warranted (see WARNINGS ). Buspirone: In nine healthy subjects, diltiazem significantly increased the mean buspirone AUC 5.5-fold and C max 4.1-fold compared to placebo. The T 1/2 and T max of buspirone were not significantly affected by diltiazem. Enhanced effects and increased toxicity of buspirone may be possible during concomitant administration with diltiazem. Subsequent dose adjustments may be necessary during coadministration, and should be based on clinical assessment. Carbamazepine: Concomitant administration of diltiazem with carbamazepine has been reported to result in elevated serum levels of carbamazepine (40% to 72% increase) resulting in toxicity in some cases. Patients receiving these drugs concurrently should be monitored for a potential drug interaction. Cimetidine: A study in six healthy volunteers has shown a significant increase in peak diltiazem plasma levels (58%) and area-under-the-curve (53%) after a 1-week course of cimetidine at 1200 mg per day and a single dose of diltiazem 60 mg. Ranitidine produced smaller, nonsignificant increases. The effect may be mediated by cimetidine's known inhibition of hepatic cytochrome P450, the enzyme system responsible for the first-pass metabolism of diltiazem. Patients currently receiving diltiazem therapy should be carefully monitored for a change in pharmacological effect when initiating and discontinuing therapy with cimetidine. An adjustment in the diltiazem dose may be warranted. Clonidine: Sinus bradycardia resulting in hospitalization and pacemaker insertion has been reported in association with the use of clonidine concurrently with diltiazem. Monitor heart rate in patients receiving concomitant diltiazem and clonidine. Cyclosporine: A pharmacokinetic interaction between diltiazem and cyclosporine has been observed during studies involving renal and cardiac transplant patients. In renal and cardiac transplant recipients, a reduction of cyclosporine trough dose ranging from 15% to 48% was necessary to maintain concentrations similar to those seen prior to the addition of diltiazem. If these agents are to be administered concurrently, cyclosporine concentrations should be monitored, especially when diltiazem therapy is initiated, adjusted, or discontinued. The effect of cyclosporine on diltiazem plasma concentrations has not been evaluated. Digitalis: Administration of diltiazem with digoxin in 24 healthy male subjects increased plasma digoxin concentrations approximately 20%. Another investigator found no increase in digoxin levels in 12 patients with coronary artery disease. Since there have been conflicting results regarding the effect of digoxin levels, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing diltiazem therapy to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization (see WARNINGS ). Ivabradine: Concurrent use of diltiazem increases exposure to ivabradine and may exacerbate bradycardia and conduction disturbances. Avoid concomitant use of ivabradine and diltiazem. Quinidine: Diltiazem significantly increases the AUC (0\u2192\u221e) of quinidine by 51%, T 1/2 by 36%, and decreases its CL oral by 33%. Monitoring for quinidine adverse effects may be warranted and the dose adjusted accordingly. Rifampin: Coadministration of rifampin with diltiazem lowered the diltiazem plasma concentrations to undetectable levels. Coadministration of diltiazem with rifampin or any known CYP3A4 inducer should be avoided when possible, and alternative therapy considered. Statins: Diltiazem is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and has been shown to increase significantly the AUC of some statins.

      "overdosage": [
        "OVERDOSAGE The oral LD 50 s in mice and rats range from 415 to 740 mg/kg and from 560 to 810 mg/kg, respectively. The intravenous LD 50 s in these species were 60 and 38 mg/kg, respectively. The oral LD 50 in dogs is considered to be in excess of 50 mg/kg, while lethality was seen in monkeys at 360 mg/kg. The toxic dose in man is not known. Due to extensive metabolism, blood levels after a standard dose of diltiazem can vary over tenfold, limiting the usefulness of blood levels in overdose cases. There have been reports of diltiazem overdose in amounts ranging from <1 g to 18 g. Of cases with known outcome, most patients recovered and in cases with a fatal outcome, the majority involved multiple drug ingestion. Events observed following diltiazem overdose included bradycardia, hypotension, heart block, and cardiac failure. Most reports of overdose described some supportive medical measure and/or drug treatment. Bradycardia frequently responded favorably to atropine, as did heart block, although cardiac pacing was also frequently utilized to treat heart block. Fluids and vasopressors were used to maintain blood pressure, and in cases of cardiac failure, inotropic agents were administered. In addition, some patients received treatment with ventilatory support, gastric lavage, activated charcoal, and/or intravenous calcium. The effectiveness of intravenous calcium administration to reverse the pharmacological effects of diltiazem overdose has been inconsistent. In a few reported cases, overdose with calcium channel blockers associated with hypotension and bradycardia that was initially refractory to atropine became more responsive to atropine after the patients received intravenous calcium. In some cases intravenous calcium has been administered (1 g calcium chloride or 3 g calcium gluconate) over 5 minutes and repeated every 10 to 20 minutes as necessary. Calcium gluconate has also been administered as a continuous infusion at a rate of 2 g per hour for 10 hours. Infusions of calcium for 24 hours or more may be required. Patients should be monitored for signs of hypercalcemia. In the event of overdose or exaggerated response, appropriate supportive measures should be employed in addition to gastrointestinal decontamination. Diltiazem does not appear to be removed by peritoneal or hemodialysis. Limited data suggest that plasmapheresis or charcoal hemoperfusion may hasten diltiazem elimination following overdose. Based on the known pharmacological effects of diltiazem and/or reported clinical experiences, the following measures may be considered: Bradycardia: Administer atropine (0.60 to 1.0 mg). If there is no response to vagal blockade, administer isoproterenol cautiously. High-Degree AV Block: Treat as for bradycardia above. Fixed high-degree AV block should be treated with cardiac pacing. Cardiac Failure: Administer inotropic agents (isoproterenol, dopamine, or dobutamine) and diuretics. Hypotension: Vasopressors (e.g., dopamine or norepinephrine). Actual treatment and dosage should depend on the severity of the clinical situation and the judgment and experience of the treating physician."

        "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Exertional Angina Pectoris Due to Atherosclerotic Coronary Artery Disease or Angina Pectoris at Rest Due to Coronary Artery Spasm: Dosage must be adjusted to each patient's needs. Starting with 30 mg four times daily, before meals and at bedtime, dosage should be increased gradually (given in divided doses three or four times daily) at 1- to 2-day intervals until optimum response is obtained. Although individual patients may respond to any dosage level, the average optimum dosage range appears to be 180 to 360 mg/day. There are no available data concerning dosage requirements in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. If the drug must be used in such patients, titration should be carried out with particular caution. Concomitant Use with Other Cardiovascular Agents Sublingual NTG may be taken as required to abort acute anginal attacks during diltiazem hydrochloride tablet therapy. Prophylactic Nitrate Therapy.

      "drug_interactions": [
        "Drug Interactions Vitamin A: Because of the relationship of Amnesteem to vitamin A, patients should be advised against taking vitamin supplements containing vitamin A to avoid additive toxic effects. Tetracyclines: Concomitant treatment with Amnesteem and tetracyclines should be avoided because Amnesteem use has been associated with a number of cases of pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines. Micro-dosed Progesterone Preparations: Micro-dosed progesterone preparations (\u201cminipills\u201d that do not contain an estrogen) may be an inadequate method of contraception during Amnesteem therapy. Although other hormonal contraceptives are highly effective, there have been reports of pregnancy from female patients who have used combined oral contraceptives, as well as transdermal patch/injectable/implantable/vaginal ring hormonal birth control products. These reports are more frequent for female patients who use only a single method of contraception. It is not known if hormonal contraceptives differ in their effectiveness when used with Amnesteem. Therefore, it is critically important for female patients of childbearing potential to select and commit to use two forms of effective contraception simultaneously, at least one of which must be a primary form (see PRECAUTIONS ). Norethindrone/ethinyl estradiol: In a study of 31 premenopausal female patients with severe recalcitrant nodular acne receiving OrthoNovum \u00ae 7/7/7 Tablets as an oral contraceptive agent, Amnesteem at the recommended dose of 1 mg/kg/day, did not induce clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone and in the serum levels of progesterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Prescribers are advised to consult the package insert of medication administered concomitantly with hormonal contraceptives, since some medications may decrease the effectiveness of these birth control products. St. John\u2019s Wort: Amnesteem use is associated with depression in some patients (see WARNINGS: Psychiatric Disorders and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Psychiatric ). Patients should be prospectively cautioned not to self-medicate with the herbal supplement St. John\u2019s Wort because a possible interaction has been suggested with hormonal contraceptives based on reports of breakthrough bleeding on oral contraceptives shortly after starting St. John's Wort. Pregnancies have been reported by users of combined hormonal contraceptives who also used some form of St. John's Wort. Phenytoin: Amnesteem has not been shown to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin in a study in seven healthy volunteers. These results are consistent with the in vitro finding that neither isotretinoin nor its metabolites induce or inhibit the activity of the CYP 2C9 human hepatic P450 enzyme. Phenytoin is known to cause osteomalacia. No formal clinical studies have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss between phenytoin and Amnesteem. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together. Systemic Corticosteroids: Systemic corticosteroids are known to cause osteoporosis. No formal clinical studies have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss between systemic corticosteroids and Amnesteem. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together."

      "geriatric_use": [
        "Geriatric Use Clinical studies of isotretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Although reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients, effects of aging might be expected to increase some risks associated with isotretinoin therapy (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS )."

      "precautions": [
        "PRECAUTIONS Amnesteem must only be prescribed by prescribers who are registered and activated with the iPLEDGE program. Amnesteem must only be dispensed by a pharmacy registered and activated with iPLEDGE, and must only be dispensed to patients who are registered and meet all the requirements of iPLEDGE. Registered and activated pharmacies must receive Amnesteem only from wholesalers registered with iPLEDGE. iPLEDGE program requirements for wholesalers, prescribers and pharmacists are described below: Wholesalers For the purpose of the iPLEDGE program, the term wholesaler refers to wholesaler, distributor and/or chain pharmacy distributor. To distribute Amnesteem, wholesalers must be registered with iPLEDGE and agree to meet all iPLEDGE requirements for wholesale distribution of isotretinoin products. Wholesalers must register with iPLEDGE by signing and returning the iPLEDGE wholesaler agreement that affirms they will comply with all iPLEDGE requirements for distribution of isotretinoin. These include: Registering prior to distributing isotretinoin and re-registering annually thereafter Distributing only FDA approved isotretinoin product Only shipping isotretinoin to wholesalers registered in the iPLEDGE program with prior written consent from the manufacturer or pharmacies licensed in the US and registered and activated in the iPLEDGE program Notifying the isotretinoin manufacturer (or delegate) of any non-registered and/or non-activated pharmacy or unregistered wholesaler that attempts to order isotretinoin Complying with inspection of wholesaler records for verification of compliance with the iPLEDGE program by the isotretinoin manufacturer (or delegate) Returning to the manufacturer (or delegate) any undistributed product if registration is revoked by the manufacturer or if the wholesaler chooses to not reregister annually Prescribers To prescribe isotretinoin, the prescriber must be registered and activated with the pregnancy risk management program iPLEDGE. Prescribers can register by signing and returning the completed registration form. Prescribers can only activate their registration by affirming that they meet requirements and will comply with all iPLEDGE requirements by attesting to the following points: I know the risk and severity of fetal injury/birth defects from isotretinoin. I know the risk factors for unplanned pregnancy and the effective measures for avoidance of unplanned pregnancy. I have the expertise to provide the patient with detailed pregnancy prevention counseling or I will refer her to an expert for such counseling, reimbursed by the manufacturer. I will comply with the iPLEDGE program requirements described in the booklets entitled The Guide to Best Practices for the iPLEDGE Program and The iPLEDGE Program Prescriber Contraception Counseling Guide. Before beginning treatment of female patients of child bearing potential with isotretinoin and on a monthly basis, the patient will be counseled to avoid pregnancy by using two forms of contraception simultaneously and continuously one month before, during and one month after isotretinoin therapy, unless the patient commits to continuous abstinence. I will not prescribe isotretinoin to any female patient of childbearing potential until verifying she has a negative screening pregnancy test and monthly negative CLIA-certified (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment) pregnancy tests. Patients should have a pregnancy test at the completion of the entire course of isotretinoin capsules and another pregnancy test one month later. I will report any pregnancy case that I become aware of while the female patient is on isotretinoin or one month after the last dose to the pregnancy registry. To prescribe isotretinoin, the Prescriber must access the iPLEDGE system via the internet (www.ipledgeprogram.com) or telephone (1-866-495-0654) to: Register each patient in the iPLEDGE program. Confirm monthly that each patient has received counseling and education. For female patients of childbearing potential: Enter patient\u2019s two chosen forms of contraception each month. Enter monthly result from CLIA-certified laboratory conducted pregnancy test. Isotretinoin must only be prescribed to female patients who are known not to be pregnant as confirmed by a negative CLIA-certified laboratory conducted pregnancy test. Isotretinoin must only be dispensed by a pharmacy registered and activated with the pregnancy risk management program iPLEDGE and only when the registered patient meets all the requirements of the iPLEDGE program. Meeting the requirements for a female patient of childbearing potential signifies that she: Has been counseled and has signed a Patient Information/Informed Consent About Birth Defects (for female patients who can get pregnant) form that contains warnings about the risk of potential birth defects if the fetus is exposed to isotretinoin. The patient must sign the informed consent form before starting treatment and patient counseling must also be done at that time and on a monthly basis thereafter. Has had two negative urine or serum pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL before receiving the initial isotretinoin prescription. The first test (a screening test) is obtained by the prescriber when the decision is made to pursue qualification of the patient for isotretinoin. The second pregnancy test (a confirmation test) must be done in a CLIA-certified laboratory. The interval between the two tests should be at least 19 days. For patients with regular menstrual cycles, the second pregnancy test should be done during the first 5 days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy and after the patient has used two forms of contraception for one month. For patients with amenorrhea, irregular cycles or using a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding, the second pregnancy test must be done immediately preceding the beginning of isotretinoin therapy and after the patient has used two forms of contraception for one month. Has had a negative result from a urine or serum pregnancy test in a CLIA-certified laboratory before receiving each subsequent course of isotretinoin. A pregnancy test must be repeated every month, in a CLIA-certified laboratory, prior to the female patient receiving each prescription. Has selected and has committed to use two forms of effective contraception simultaneously, at least one of which must be a primary form, unless the patient commits to continuous abstinence from heterosexual contact, or the patient has undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or has been medically confirmed to be post-menopausal. Patients must use two forms of effective contraception for at least one month prior to initiation of isotretinoin therapy, during isotretinoin therapy and for one month after discontinuing isotretinoin therapy. Counseling about contraception and behaviors associated with an increased risk of pregnancy must be repeated on a monthly basis. If the patient has unprotected heterosexual intercourse at any time one month before, during or one month after therapy, she must: Stop taking Amnesteem immediately, if on therapy Have a pregnancy test at least 19 days after the last act of unprotected heterosexual intercourse Start using two forms of effective contraception simultaneously again for one month before resuming Amnesteem therapy Have a second pregnancy test after using two forms of effective contraception for one month as described above depending on whether she has regular menses or not. Effective forms of contraception include both primary and secondary forms of contraception: Primary forms tubal sterilization partner\u2019s vasectomy intrauterine device hormonal (combination oral contraceptives, transdermal patch, injectables, implantables or vaginal ring) Secondary forms Barrier: male latex condom with or without spermicide diaphragm with spermicide cervical cap with spermicide Other: vaginal sponge (contains spermicide) Any birth control method can fail. There have been reports of pregnancy from female patients who have used oral contraceptives, as well as transdermal patch/injectable/implantable/vaginal ring hormonal birth control products; these pregnancies occurred while these patients were taking Amnesteem. These reports are more frequent for female patients who use only a single method of contraception. Therefore, it is critically important that female patients of childbearing potential use two effective forms of contraception simultaneously. Patients must receive written warnings about the rates of possible contraception failure (included in patient education kits). Using two forms of contraception simultaneously substantially reduces the chances that a female will become pregnant over the risk of pregnancy with either form alone. A drug interaction that decreases effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives has not been entirely ruled out for Amnesteem (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Although hormonal contraceptives are highly effective, prescribers are advised to consult the package insert of any medication administered concomitantly with hormonal contraceptives, since some medications may decrease the effectiveness of these birth control products. Patients should be prospectively cautioned not to self-medicate with the herbal supplement St. John\u2019s Wort because a possible interaction has been suggested with hormonal contraceptives based on reports of breakthrough bleeding on oral contraceptives shortly after starting St. John\u2019s Wort. Pregnancies have been reported by users of combined hormonal contraceptives who also used some form of St. John\u2019s Wort. If a pregnancy does occur during Amnesteem treatment, Amnesteem must be discontinued immediately. The patient should be referred to an Obstetrician-Gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Any suspected fetal exposure during or one month after Amnesteem therapy must be reported immediately to the FDA via the MedWatch number 1-800-FDA-1088 and also to the iPLEDGE pregnancy registry at 1-866-495-0654 or via the internet (www.ipledgeprogram.com). All Patients Isotretinoin is contraindicated in female patients who are pregnant. To receive isotretinoin all patients must meet all of the following conditions: Must be registered with the iPLEDGE program by the prescriber Must understand that severe birth defects can occur with the use of isotretinoin by female patients Must be reliable in understanding and carrying out instructions Must sign a Patient Information/Informed Consent (for all patients) form that contains warnings about the potential risks associated with isotretinoin Must fill and pick up the prescription within 7 days of the date of specimen collection for the pregnancy test for female patients of child bearing potential Must fill and pick up the prescription within 30 days of the office visit for male patients and females patients not of child bearing potential Must not donate blood while on isotretinoin and for one month after treatment has ended Must not share isotretinoin with anyone, even someone who has similar symptoms Female Patients of Childbearing Potential Isotretinoin is contraindicated in female patients who are pregnant. In addition to the requirements for all patients described above, female patients of childbearing potential must meet the following conditions: Must NOT be pregnant or breast-feeding Must comply with the required pregnancy testing at a CLIA-certified laboratory Must fill and pick up the prescription within 7 days of the date of specimen collection for the pregnancy test Must be capable of complying with the mandatory contraceptive measures required for isotretinoin therapy, or commit to continuous abstinence from heterosexual intercourse and understand behaviors associated with an increased risk of pregnancy Must understand that it is her responsibility to avoid pregnancy one month before, during and one month after isotretinoin therapy Must have signed an additional Patient Information/Informed Consent About Birth Defects (for female patients who can get pregnant) form, before starting isotretinoin, that contains warnings about the risk of potential birth defects if the fetus is exposed to isotretinoin Must access the iPLEDGE system via the internet (www.ipledgeprogram.com) or telephone (1-866-495-0654), before starting isotretinoin, on a monthly basis during therapy and one month after the last dose to answer questions on the program requirements and to enter the patient\u2019s two chosen forms of contraception Must have been informed of the purpose and importance of providing information to the iPLEDGE program should she become pregnant while taking isotretinoin or within one month of the last dose Pharmacists To dispense isotretinoin, pharmacies must be registered and activated with the pregnancy risk management program iPLEDGE. The Responsible Site Pharmacist must register the pharmacy by signing and returning the completed registration form. After registration, the Responsible Site Pharmacist can only activate the pharmacy registration by affirming that they meet requirements and will comply with all iPLEDGE requirements by attesting to the following points: I know the risk and severity of fetal injury/birth defects from isotretinoin. I will train all pharmacists, who participate in the filling and dispensing of isotretinoin prescriptions, on the iPLEDGE program requirements. I will comply and seek to ensure all pharmacists who participate in the filling and dispensing of isotretinoin prescriptions comply with the iPLEDGE program requirements described in the booklet entitled Pharmacist Guide for the iPLEDGE Program . I will obtain Amnesteem product only from iPLEDGE registered wholesalers. I will not sell, buy, borrow, loan or otherwise transfer isotretinoin in any manner to or from another pharmacy. I will return to the manufacturer (or delegate) any unused product if registration is revoked by the manufacturer or if the pharmacy chooses to not reactivate annually. I will not fill isotretinoin for any party other than a qualified patient. To dispense isotretinoin, the pharmacist must: be trained by the Responsible Site Pharmacist concerning the iPLEDGE program requirements. obtain authorization from the iPLEDGE program via the internet (www.ipledgeprogram.com) or telephone (1-866-495-0654) for every isotretinoin prescription. Authorization signifies that the patient has met all program requirements and is qualified to receive Amnesteem. write the Risk Management Authorization (RMA) number on the prescription. Amnesteem must only be dispensed: in no more than a 30 day supply with an Amnesteem Medication Guide after authorization from the iPLEDGE program prior to the \u201cdo not dispense to patient after\u201d date provided by the iPLEDGE system (within 30 days of the office visit for male patients and female patients not of child bearing potential and within 7 days of the date of specimen collection for female patients of child bearing potential) with a new prescription for refills and another authorization from the iPLEDGE program (No automatic refills are allowed) An Amnesteem Medication Guide must be given to the patient each time Amnesteem is dispensed, as required by law. This Amnesteem Medication Guide is an important part of the risk management program for the patients. Amnesteem must not be prescribed, dispensed or otherwise obtained through the internet or any other means outside of the iPLEDGE program. Only FDA-approved Amnesteem products must be distributed, prescribed, dispensed and used. Patients must fill Amnesteem prescriptions only at U.S. licensed pharmacies. A description of the iPLEDGE program educational materials available with iPLEDGE is provided below. The main goal of these educational materials is to explain the iPLEDGE program requirements and to reinforce the educational messages. The Guide to Best Practices for the iPLEDGE Program includes: isotretinoin teratogenic potential, information on pregnancy testing, and the method to complete a qualified Amnesteem prescription. The iPLEDGE Program Prescriber Contraception Counseling Guide includes: specific information about effective contraception, the limitations of contraceptive methods, behaviors associated with an increased risk of contraceptive failure and pregnancy and the methods to evaluate pregnancy risk. The Pharmacist Guide for the iPLEDGE Program includes: isotretinoin teratogenic potential and the method to obtain authorization to dispense an isotretinoin prescription. The iPLEDGE program is a systematic approach to comprehensive patient education about their responsibilities and includes education for contraception compliance and reinforcement of educational messages. The iPLEDGE program includes information on the risks and benefits of Amnesteem which is linked to the Medication Guide dispensed by pharmacists with each isotretinoin prescription. Female patients not of childbearing potential and male patients, and female patients of childbearing potential are provided with separate booklets. Each booklet contains information on isotretinoin therapy including precautions and warnings, a Patient Information/Informed Consent (for all patients) form and a toll-free line which provides isotretinoin information in two languages. The booklet for female patients not of childbearing potential and male patients, The iPLEDGE Program Guide to Isotretinoin for Male Patients and Female Patients Who Cannot Get Pregnant , also includes information about male reproduction and a warning not to share Amnesteem with others or to donate blood during isotretinoin therapy and for one month following discontinuation of isotretinoin. The booklet for female patients of childbearing potential, The iPLEDGE Program Guide to Isotretinoin for Female Patients Who Can Get Pregnant , includes a referral program that offers female patients free contraception counseling, reimbursed by the manufacturer, by a reproductive specialist; and a second Patient Information/Informed Consent About Birth Defects (for female patients who can get pregnant) form concerning birth defects. The booklet, The iPLEDGE Program Birth Control Workbook includes information on the types of contraceptive methods, the selection and use of appropriate, effective contraception, the rates of possible contraceptive failure and a toll-free contraception counseling line. In addition, there is a patient educational DVD with the following videos\u2014\u201cBe Prepared, Be Protected\u201d and \u201cBe Aware: The Risk of Pregnancy While on Isotretinoin\u201d (see Information for Patients ). General Although an effect of Amnesteem on bone loss is not established, physicians should use caution when prescribing Amnesteem to patients with a genetic predisposition for age related osteoporosis, a history of childhood osteoporosis conditions, osteomalacia, or other disorders of bone metabolism. This would include patients diagnosed with anorexia nervosa and those who are on chronic drug therapy that causes drug-induced osteoporosis/osteomalacia and/or affects vitamin D metabolism, such as systemic corticosteroids and any anticonvulsant. Patients may be at increased risk when participating in sports with repetitive impact where the risks of spondylolisthesis with and without pars fractures and hip growth plate injuries in early and late adolescence are known. There are spontaneous reports of fractures and/or delayed healing in patients while on therapy with Amnesteem or following cessation of therapy with Amnesteem while involved in these activities. While causality to Amnesteem has not been established, an effect must not be ruled out. Information for Patients See PRECAUTIONS and Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS . Patients must be instructed to read the Medication Guide supplied as required by law when Amnesteem is dispensed. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document. For additional information, patients must also be instructed to read the iPLEDGE program patient educational materials. All patients must sign the Patient Information/Informed Consent (for all patients) form. Female patients of childbearing potential must be instructed that they must not be pregnant when Amnesteem therapy is initiated, and that they should use two forms of effective contraception simultaneously for one month before starting Amnesteem, while taking Amnesteem, and for one month after Amnesteem has been stopped, unless they commit to continuous abstinence from heterosexual intercourse. They should also sign a second Patient Information/Informed Consent About Birth Defects (for female patients who can get pregnant) form prior to beginning Amnesteem therapy. They should be given an opportunity to view the patient DVD provided by the manufacturer to the prescriber. The DVD includes information about contraception, the most common reasons that contraception fails, and the importance of using two forms of effective contraception when taking teratogenic drugs and comprehensive information about types of potential birth defects which could occur if a female patient who is pregnant takes Amnesteem at any time during pregnancy. Female patients should be seen by their prescribers monthly and have a urine or serum pregnancy test, in a CLIA-certified laboratory, performed each month during treatment to confirm negative pregnancy status before another Amnesteem prescription is written (see Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Amnesteem is found in the semen of male patients taking Amnesteem, but the amount delivered to a female partner would be about one million times lower than an oral dose of 40 mg. While the no-effect limit for isotretinoin induced embryopathy is unknown, 20 years of post-marketing reports include four with isolated defects compatible with features of retinoid exposed fetuses; however two of these reports were incomplete and two had other possible explanations for the defects observed. Prescribers should be alert to the warning signs of psychiatric disorders to guide patients to receive the help they need. Therefore, prior to initiation of Amnesteem treatment, patients and family members should be asked about any history of psychiatric disorder, and at each visit during treatment patients should be assessed for symptoms of depression, mood disturbance, psychosis or aggression to determine if further evaluation may be necessary. Signs and symptoms of depression include sad mood, hopelessness, feelings of guilt, worthlessness or helplessness, loss of pleasure or interest in activities, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, change in sleep pattern, change in weight or appetite, suicidal thoughts or attempts, restlessness, irritability, acting on dangerous impulses and persistent physical symptoms unresponsive to treatment. Patients should stop Amnesteem and the patient or a family member should promptly contact their prescriber if the patient develops depression, mood disturbance, psychosis or aggression, without waiting until the next visit. Discontinuation of Amnesteem treatment may be insufficient; further evaluation may be necessary. While such monitoring may be helpful, it may not detect all patients at risk. Patients may report mental health problems or family history of psychiatric disorders. These reports should be discussed with the patient and/or the patient\u2019s family. A referral to a mental health professional may be necessary. The physician should consider whether Amnesteem therapy is appropriate in this setting; for some patients the risks may outweigh the benefits of Amnesteem therapy. Patients must be informed that some patients, while taking Amnesteem or soon after stopping Amnesteem, have become depressed or developed other serious mental problems. Symptoms of depression include sad, \u201canxious\u201d or empty mood, irritability, acting on dangerous impulses, anger, loss of pleasure or interest in social or sports activities, sleeping too much or too little, changes in weight or appetite, school or work performance going down or trouble concentrating. Some patients taking Amnesteem have had thoughts about hurting themselves or putting an end to their own lives (suicidal thoughts). Some people tried to end their own lives. And some people have ended their own lives. There were reports that some of these people did not appear depressed. There have been reports of patients on Amnesteem becoming aggressive or violent. No one knows if Amnesteem caused these behaviors or if they would have happened even if the person did not take Amnesteem. Some people have had other signs of depression while taking Amnesteem. Patients must be informed that they must not share Amnesteem with anyone else because of the risk of birth defects and other serious adverse events. Patients must be informed not to donate blood during therapy and for one month following discontinuation of the drug because the blood might be given to a pregnant female patient whose fetus must not be exposed to Amnesteem. Patients should be reminded to take Amnesteem with a meal (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). To decrease the risk of esophageal irritation, patients should swallow the capsules with a full glass of liquid. Patients should be informed that transient exacerbation (flare) of acne has been seen, generally during the initial period of therapy. Wax epilation and skin resurfacing procedures (such as dermabrasion, laser) should be avoided during Amnesteem therapy and for at least 6 months thereafter due to the possibility of scarring (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Skin and Appendages ). Patients should be advised to avoid prolonged exposure to UV rays or sunlight. Patients should be informed that they may experience decreased tolerance to contact lenses during and after therapy. Patients should be informed that approximately 16% of patients treated with Amnesteem in a clinical trial developed musculoskeletal symptoms (including arthralgia) during treatment. In general, these symptoms were mild to moderate, but occasionally required discontinuation of the drug. Transient pain in the chest has been reported less frequently. In the clinical trial, these symptoms generally cleared rapidly after discontinuation of Amnesteem, but in some cases persisted (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Musculoskeletal ). There have been rare post-marketing reports of rhabdomyolysis, some associated with strenuous physical activity (see Laboratory Tests: CPK ). Pediatric patients and their caregivers should be informed that approximately 29% (104/358) of pediatric patients treated with Amnesteem developed back pain. Back pain was severe in 13.5% (14/104) of the cases and occurred at a higher frequency in female patients than male patients. Arthralgias were experienced in 22% (79/358) of pediatric patients. Arthralgias were severe in 7.6% (6/79) of patients. Appropriate evaluation of the musculoskeletal system should be done in patients who present with these symptoms during or after a course of Amnesteem. Consideration should be given to discontinuation of Amnesteem if any significant abnormality is found. Neutropenia and rare cases of agranulocytosis have been reported. Amnesteem should be discontinued if clinically significant decreases in white cell counts occur. Patients should be advised that severe skin reactions (Steven-Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) have been reported in post-marketing data. Amnesteem should be discontinued if clinically significant skin reactions occur. Hypersensitivity Anaphylactic reactions and other allergic reactions have been reported. Cutaneous allergic reactions and serious cases of allergic vasculitis, often with purpura (bruises and red patches) of the extremities and extracutaneous involvement (including renal) have been reported. Severe allergic reaction necessitates discontinuation of therapy and appropriate medical management. Drug Interactions Vitamin A: Because of the relationship of Amnesteem to vitamin A, patients should be advised against taking vitamin supplements containing vitamin A to avoid additive toxic effects. Tetracyclines: Concomitant treatment with Amnesteem and tetracyclines should be avoided because Amnesteem use has been associated with a number of cases of pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines. Micro-dosed Progesterone Preparations: Micro-dosed progesterone preparations (\u201cminipills\u201d that do not contain an estrogen) may be an inadequate method of contraception during Amnesteem therapy. Although other hormonal contraceptives are highly effective, there have been reports of pregnancy from female patients who have used combined oral contraceptives, as well as transdermal patch/injectable/implantable/vaginal ring hormonal birth control products. These reports are more frequent for female patients who use only a single method of contraception. It is not known if hormonal contraceptives differ in their effectiveness when used with Amnesteem. Therefore, it is critically important for female patients of childbearing potential to select and commit to use two forms of effective contraception simultaneously, at least one of which must be a primary form (see PRECAUTIONS ). Norethindrone/ethinyl estradiol: In a study of 31 premenopausal female patients with severe recalcitrant nodular acne receiving OrthoNovum \u00ae 7/7/7 Tablets as an oral contraceptive agent, Amnesteem at the recommended dose of 1 mg/kg/day, did not induce clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone and in the serum levels of progesterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Prescribers are advised to consult the package insert of medication administered concomitantly with hormonal contraceptives, since some medications may decrease the effectiveness of these birth control products. St. John\u2019s Wort: Amnesteem use is associated with depression in some patients (see WARNINGS: Psychiatric Disorders and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Psychiatric ). Patients should be prospectively cautioned not to self-medicate with the herbal supplement St. John\u2019s Wort because a possible interaction has been suggested with hormonal contraceptives based on reports of breakthrough bleeding on oral contraceptives shortly after starting St. John's Wort. Pregnancies have been reported by users of combined hormonal contraceptives who also used some form of St. John's Wort. Phenytoin: Amnesteem has not been shown to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin in a study in seven healthy volunteers. These results are consistent with the in vitro finding that neither isotretinoin nor its metabolites induce or inhibit the activity of the CYP 2C9 human hepatic P450 enzyme. Phenytoin is known to cause osteomalacia. No formal clinical studies have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss between phenytoin and Amnesteem. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together. Systemic Corticosteroids: Systemic corticosteroids are known to cause osteoporosis. No formal clinical studies have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss between systemic corticosteroids and Amnesteem. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together. Laboratory Tests Pregnancy Test Female patients of childbearing potential must have had two negative urine or serum pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL before receiving the initial Amnesteem prescription. The first test (a screening test) is obtained by the prescriber when the decision is made to pursue qualification of the patient for Amnesteem. The second pregnancy test (a confirmation test) must be done in a CLIA-certified laboratory. The interval between the two tests must be at least 19 days. For patients with regular menstrual cycles, the second pregnancy test must be done during the first 5 days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of Amnesteem therapy and after the patient has used 2 forms of contraception for 1 month. For patients with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding, the second pregnancy test must be done immediately preceding the beginning of Amnesteem therapy and after the patient has used 2 forms of contraception for 1 month. Each month of therapy, patients must have a negative result from a urine or serum pregnancy test. A pregnancy test must be repeated each month, in a CLIA-certified laboratory, prior to the female patient receiving each prescription. Lipids Pretreatment and follow-up blood lipids should be obtained under fasting conditions. After consumption of alcohol, at least 36 hours should elapse before these determinations are made. It is recommended that these tests be performed at weekly or biweekly intervals until the lipid response to Amnesteem is established. The incidence of hypertriglyceridemia is one patient in four on Amnesteem therapy (see WARNINGS: Lipids ). Liver Function Tests Since elevations of liver enzymes have been observed during clinical trials, and hepatitis has been reported, pretreatment and follow-up liver function tests should be performed at weekly or biweekly intervals until the response to Amnesteem has been established (see WARNINGS: Hepatotoxicity ). Glucose Some patients receiving Amnesteem have experienced problems in the control of their blood sugar. In addition, new cases of diabetes have been diagnosed during Amnesteem therapy, although no causal relationship has been established. CPK Some patients undergoing vigorous physical activity while on Amnesteem therapy have experienced elevated CPK levels; however, the clinical significance is unknown. There have been rare post-marketing reports of rhabdomyolysis, some associated with strenuous physical activity. In a clinical trial of 217 pediatric patients (12 to 17 years) with severe recalcitrant nodular acne, transient elevations in CPK were observed in 12% of patients, including those undergoing strenuous physical activity in association with reported musculoskeletal adverse events such as back pain, arthralgia, limb injury, or muscle sprain. In these patients, approximately half of the CPK elevations returned to normal within 2 weeks and half returned to normal within 4 weeks. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported in this trial. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In male and female Fischer 344 rats given oral isotretinoin at dosages of 8 or 32 mg/kg/day (1.3 to 5.3 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area) for greater than 18 months, there was a dose related increased incidence of pheochromocytoma relative to controls. The incidence of adrenal medullary hyperplasia was also increased at the higher dosage in both sexes. The relatively high level of spontaneous pheochromocytomas occurring in the male Fischer 344 rat makes it an equivocal model for study of this tumor; therefore, the relevance of this tumor to the human population is uncertain. The Ames test was conducted with isotretinoin in two laboratories. The results of the tests in one laboratory were negative while in the second laboratory a weakly positive response (less than 1.6 x background) was noted in S. typhimurium TA100 when the assay was conducted with metabolic activation. No dose-response effect was seen and all other strains were negative. Additionally, other tests designed to assess genotoxicity (Chinese hamster cell assay, mouse micronucleus test, S. cerevisiae D7 assay, in vitro clastogenesis assay with human-derived lymphocytes and unscheduled DNA synthesis assay) were all negative. In rats, no adverse effects on gonadal function, fertility, conception rate, gestation or parturition were observed at oral dosages of isotretinoin of 2, 8 or 32 mg/kg/day (0.3, 1.3 or 5.3 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area). In dogs, testicular atrophy was noted after treatment with oral isotretinoin for approximately 30 weeks at dosages of 20 or 60 mg/kg/day (10 or 30 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area). In general, there was microscopic evidence for appreciable depression of spermatogenesis but some sperm were observed in all testes examined and in no instance were completely atrophic tubules seen. In studies of 66 men, 30 of whom were patients with nodular acne under treatment with oral isotretinoin, no significant changes were noted in the count or motility of spermatozoa in the ejaculate. In a study of 50 men (ages 17 to 32 years) receiving Amnesteem (isotretinoin) therapy for nodular acne, no significant effects were seen on ejaculate volume, sperm count, total sperm motility, morphology or seminal plasma fructose. Pregnancy Category X See Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS . Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects, nursing mothers should not receive Amnesteem. Pediatric Use The use of Amnesteem in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age has not been studied. The use of Amnesteem for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne in pediatric patients ages 12 to 17 years should be given careful consideration, especially for those patients where a known metabolic or structural bone disease exists (see PRECAUTIONS: General ). Use of Amnesteem in this age group for severe recalcitrant nodular acne is supported by evidence from a clinical study comparing 103 pediatric patients (13 to 17 years) to 197 adult patients (\u2265 18 years). Results from this study demonstrated that Amnesteem, at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day given in two divided doses, was equally effective in treating severe recalcitrant nodular acne in both pediatric and adult patients. In studies with Amnesteem, adverse reactions reported in pediatric patients were similar to those described in adults except for the increased incidence of back pain and arthralgia (both of which were sometimes severe) and myalgia in pediatric patients (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). In an open-label clinical trial (N = 217) of a single course of therapy with Amnesteem for severe recalcitrant nodular acne, bone density measurements at several skeletal sites were not significantly decreased (lumbar spine change > -4% and total hip change > -5%) or were increased in the majority of patients. One patient had a decrease in lumbar spine bone mineral density > 4% based on unadjusted data. Sixteen (7.9%) patients had decreases in lumbar spine bone mineral density > 4%, and all the other patients (92%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Nine patients (4.5%) had a decrease in total hip bone mineral density > 5% based on unadjusted data. Twenty one (10.6%) patients had decreases in total hip bone mineral density > 5%, and all the other patients (89%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Follow-up studies performed in eight of the patients with decreased bone mineral density for up to 11 months thereafter demonstrated increasing bone density in five patients at the lumbar spine, while the other three patients had lumbar spine bone density measurements below baseline values. Total hip bone mineral densities remained below baseline (range \u20131.6% to \u20137.6%) in five of eight patients (62.5%). In a separate open-label extension study of ten patients, ages 13 to 18 years, who started a second course of Amnesteem 4 months after the first course, two patients showed a decrease in mean lumbar spine bone mineral density up to 3.25% (see WARNINGS: Skeletal: Bone Mineral Density ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of isotretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Although reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients, effects of aging might be expected to increase some risks associated with isotretinoin therapy (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS )."

        "Pharmacokinetics Absorption Due to its high lipophilicity, oral absorption of isotretinoin is enhanced when given with a high fat meal. In a crossover study, 74 healthy adult subjects received a single 80 mg oral dose (2 x 40 mg capsules) of Amnesteem under fasted and fed conditions. Both peak plasma concentration (C max ) and the total exposure (AUC) of isotretinoin were more than doubled following a standardized high fat meal when compared with Amnesteem given under fasted conditions (see Table 2 ). The observed elimination half-life was unchanged. This lack of change in half-life suggests that food increases the bioavailability of isotretinoin without altering its disposition. The time to peak concentration (T max ) was also increased with food and may be related to a longer absorption phase. Therefore, Amnesteem capsules should always be taken with food (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Clinical studies have shown that there is no difference in the pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin between patients with nodular acne and healthy subjects with normal skin. Table 2. Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Isotretinoin Mean (%CV), N = 74 Amnesteem 2 x 40 mg Capsules AUC 0-\u221e (ng\u2022hr/mL) C max (ng/mL) T max (hr) t 1/2 (hr) Fed 10,004 (22%) 862 (22%) 5.3 (77%) 21 (39%) Fasted 3,703 (46%) 301 (63%) 3.2 (56%) 21 (30%) Distribution Isotretinoin is more than 99.9% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin. Metabolism Following oral administration of isotretinoin, at least three metabolites have been identified in human plasma: 4- oxo -isotretinoin, retinoic acid (tretinoin), and 4- oxo -retinoic acid (4- oxo -tretinoin). Retinoic acid and 13- cis -retinoic acid are geometric isomers and show reversible interconversion. The administration of one isomer will give rise to the other. Isotretinoin is also irreversibly oxidized to 4- oxo -isotretinoin, which forms its geometric isomer 4- oxo -tretinoin. After a single 80 mg oral dose of Amnesteem to 74 healthy adult subjects, concurrent administration of food increased the extent of formation of all metabolites in plasma when compared to the extent of formation under fasted conditions. All of these metabolites possess retinoid activity that is in some in vitro models more than that of the parent isotretinoin. However, the clinical significance of these models is unknown. After multiple oral dose administration of isotretinoin to adult cystic acne patients (\u2265 18 years), the exposure of patients to 4- oxo -isotretinoin at steady-state under fasted and fed conditions was approximately 3.4 times higher than that of isotretinoin. In vitro studies indicate that the primary P450 isoforms involved in isotretinoin metabolism are 2C8, 2C9, 3A4 and 2B6. Isotretinoin and its metabolites are further metabolized into conjugates, which are then excreted in urine and feces. Elimination Following oral administration of an 80 mg dose of 14 C-isotretinoin as a liquid suspension, 14 C-activity in blood declined with a half-life of 90 hours. The metabolites of isotretinoin and any conjugates are ultimately excreted in the feces and urine in relatively equal amounts (total of 65% to 83%). After a single 80 mg oral dose of Amnesteem to 74 healthy adult subjects under fed conditions, the mean \u00b1 SD elimination half-lives (t 1/2 ) of isotretinoin and 4- oxo -isotretinoin were 21 \u00b1 8.2 hours and 24 \u00b1 5.3 hours, respectively. After both single and multiple doses, the observed accumulation ratios of isotretinoin ranged from 0.9 to 5.43 in patients with cystic acne."

        "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Severe Recalcitrant Nodular Acne Amnesteem is indicated for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne. Nodules are inflammatory lesions with a diameter of 5 mm or greater. The nodules may become suppurative or hemorrhagic. \u201cSevere,\u201d by definition, 2 means \u201cmany\u201d as opposed to \u201cfew or several\u201d nodules. Because of significant adverse effects associated with its use, Amnesteem should be reserved for patients with severe nodular acne who are unresponsive to conventional therapy, including systemic antibiotics . In addition, Amnesteem is indicated only for those female patients who are not pregnant, because Amnesteem can cause severe birth defects (see Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS ). A single course of therapy for 15 to 20 weeks has been shown to result in complete and prolonged remission of disease in many patients. 1,3,4 If a second course of therapy is needed, it should not be initiated until at least 8 weeks after completion of the first course, because experience has shown that patients may continue to improve while off Amnesteem. The optimal interval before retreatment has not been defined for patients who have not completed skeletal growth (see WARNINGS: Skeletal: Bone Mineral Density , Hyperostosis , and Premature Epiphyseal Closure )."

        "Pediatric Use The use of Amnesteem in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age has not been studied. The use of Amnesteem for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne in pediatric patients ages 12 to 17 years should be given careful consideration, especially for those patients where a known metabolic or structural bone disease exists (see PRECAUTIONS: General ). Use of Amnesteem in this age group for severe recalcitrant nodular acne is supported by evidence from a clinical study comparing 103 pediatric patients (13 to 17 years) to 197 adult patients (\u2265 18 years). Results from this study demonstrated that Amnesteem, at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day given in two divided doses, was equally effective in treating severe recalcitrant nodular acne in both pediatric and adult patients. In studies with Amnesteem, adverse reactions reported in pediatric patients were similar to those described in adults except for the increased incidence of back pain and arthralgia (both of which were sometimes severe) and myalgia in pediatric patients (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). In an open-label clinical trial (N = 217) of a single course of therapy with Amnesteem for severe recalcitrant nodular acne, bone density measurements at several skeletal sites were not significantly decreased (lumbar spine change > -4% and total hip change > -5%) or were increased in the majority of patients. One patient had a decrease in lumbar spine bone mineral density > 4% based on unadjusted data. Sixteen (7.9%) patients had decreases in lumbar spine bone mineral density > 4%, and all the other patients (92%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Nine patients (4.5%) had a decrease in total hip bone mineral density > 5% based on unadjusted data. Twenty one (10.6%) patients had decreases in total hip bone mineral density > 5%, and all the other patients (89%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Follow-up studies performed in eight of the patients with decreased bone mineral density for up to 11 months thereafter demonstrated increasing bone density in five patients at the lumbar spine, while the other three patients had lumbar spine bone density measurements below baseline values. Total hip bone mineral densities remained below baseline (range \u20131.6% to \u20137.6%) in five of eight patients (62.5%). In a separate open-label extension study of ten patients, ages 13 to 18 years, who started a second course of Amnesteem 4 months after the first course, two patients showed a decrease in mean lumbar spine bone mineral density up to 3.25% (see WARNINGS: Skeletal: Bone Mineral Density )."

        "WARNINGS Psychiatric Disorders Amnesteem may cause depression, psychosis and, rarely, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide, and aggressive and/or violent behaviors. No mechanism of action has been established for these events (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Psychiatric ). Prescribers should read the brochure, Recognizing Psychiatric Disorders in Adolescents and Young Adults: A Guide for Prescribers of Isotretinoin. Prescribers should be alert to the warning signs of psychiatric disorders to guide patients to receive the help they need. Therefore, prior to initiation of Amnesteem therapy, patients and family members should be asked about any history of psychiatric disorder, and at each visit during therapy patients should be assessed for symptoms of depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression to determine if further evaluation may be necessary. Signs and symptoms of depression, as described in the brochure (\u201cRecognizing Psychiatric Disorders in Adolescents and Young Adults\u201d), include sad mood, hopelessness, feelings of guilt, worthlessness or helplessness, loss of pleasure or interest in activities, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, change in sleep pattern, change in weight or appetite, suicidal thoughts or attempts, restlessness, irritability, acting on dangerous impulses, and persistent physical symptoms unresponsive to treatment. Patients should stop Amnesteem and the patient or a family member should promptly contact their prescriber if the patient develops depression, mood disturbance, psychosis, or aggression, without waiting until the next visit. Discontinuation of Amnesteem therapy may be insufficient; further evaluation may be necessary. While such monitoring may be helpful, it may not detect all patients at risk. Patients may report mental health problems or family history of psychiatric disorders. These reports should be discussed with the patient and/or the patient\u2019s family. A referral to a mental health professional may be necessary. The physician should consider whether Amnesteem therapy is appropriate in this setting; for some patients the risks may outweigh the benefits of Amnesteem therapy. Pseudotumor Cerebri Amnesteem use has been associated with a number of cases of pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines. Concomitant treatment with tetracyclines should therefore be avoided. Early signs and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri include papilledema, headache, nausea and vomiting, and visual disturbances. Patients with these symptoms should be screened for papilledema and, if present, they should be told to discontinue Amnesteem immediately and be referred to a neurologist for further diagnosis and care (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Neurological ). Serious Skin Reactions There have been post-marketing reports of erythema multiforme and severe skin reactions [e.g., Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)] associated with isotretinoin use. These events may be serious and result in death, life-threatening events, hospitalization or disability. Patients should be monitored closely for severe skin reactions and discontinuation of Amnesteem should be considered if warranted. Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis has been reported in patients with either elevated or normal serum triglyceride levels. In rare instances, fatal hemorrhagic pancreatitis has been reported. Amnesteem should be stopped if hypertriglyceridemia cannot be controlled at an acceptable level or if symptoms of pancreatitis occur. Lipids Elevations of serum triglycerides in excess of 800 mg/dL have been reported in patients treated with Amnesteem. Marked elevations of serum triglycerides were reported in approximately 25% of patients receiving Amnesteem in clinical trials. In addition, approximately 15% developed a decrease in high-density lipoproteins and about 7% showed an increase in cholesterol levels. In clinical trials, the effects on triglycerides, HDL and cholesterol were reversible upon cessation of Amnesteem therapy. Some patients have been able to reverse triglyceride elevation by reduction in weight, restriction of dietary fat and alcohol, and reduction in dose while continuing Amnesteem. 5 Blood lipid determinations should be performed before Amnesteem is given and then at intervals until the lipid response to Amnesteem is established, which usually occurs within 4 weeks. Especially careful consideration must be given to risk/benefit for patients who may be at high risk during Amnesteem therapy (patients with diabetes, obesity, increased alcohol intake, lipid metabolism disorder or familial history of lipid metabolism disorder). If Amnesteem therapy is instituted, more frequent checks of serum values for lipids and/or blood sugar are recommended (see PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests ). The cardiovascular consequences of hypertriglyceridemia associated with Amnesteem are unknown. Animal Studies In rats given 8 or 32 mg/kg/day of isotretinoin (1.3 to 5.3 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mg/kg/day after normalization for total body surface area) for 18 months or longer, the incidences of focal calcification, fibrosis and inflammation of the myocardium, calcification of coronary, pulmonary and mesenteric arteries, and metastatic calcification of the gastric mucosa were greater than in control rats of similar age. Focal endocardial and myocardial calcifications associated with calcification of the coronary arteries were observed in two dogs after approximately 6 to 7 months of treatment with isotretinoin at a dosage of 60 to 120 mg/kg/day (30 to 60 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area). Hearing Impairment Impaired hearing has been reported in patients taking Amnesteem; in some cases, the hearing impairment has been reported to persist after therapy has been discontinued. Mechanism(s) and causality for this event have not been established. Patients who experience tinnitus or hearing impairment should discontinue Amnesteem treatment and be referred for specialized care for further evaluation (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Special Senses ). Hepatotoxicity Clinical hepatitis considered to be possibly or probably related to Amnesteem therapy has been reported. Additionally, mild to moderate elevations of liver enzymes have been observed in approximately 15% of individuals treated during clinical trials, some of which normalized with dosage reduction or continued administration of the drug. If normalization does not readily occur or if hepatitis is suspected during treatment with Amnesteem, the drug should be discontinued and the etiology further investigated. Inflammatory Bowel Disease Amnesteem has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (including regional ileitis) in patients without a prior history of intestinal disorders. In some instances, symptoms have been reported to persist after Amnesteem treatment has been stopped. Patients experiencing abdominal pain, rectal bleeding or severe diarrhea should discontinue Amnesteem immediately (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Gastrointestinal ). Skeletal Bone Mineral Density Effects of multiple courses of Amnesteem on the developing musculoskeletal system are unknown. There is some evidence that long-term, high dose, or multiple courses of therapy with isotretinoin have more of an effect than a single course of therapy on the musculoskeletal system. In an open-label clinical trial (N = 217) of a single course of therapy with Amnesteem for severe recalcitrant nodular acne, bone density measurements at several skeletal sites were not significantly decreased (lumbar spine change > -4% and total hip change > -5%) or were increased in the majority of patients. One patient had a decrease in lumbar spine bone mineral density > 4% based on unadjusted data. Sixteen (7.9%) patients had decreases in lumbar spine bone mineral density > 4%, and all the other patients (92%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Nine patients (4.5%) had a decrease in total hip bone mineral density > 5% based on unadjusted data. Twenty one (10.6%) patients had decreases in total hip bone mineral density > 5%, and all the other patients (89%) did not have significant decreases or had increases (adjusted for body mass index). Follow-up studies performed in eight of the patients with decreased bone mineral density for up to 11 months thereafter demonstrated increasing bone density in five patients at the lumbar spine, while the other three patients had lumbar spine bone density measurements below baseline values. Total hip bone mineral densities remained below baseline (range \u20131.6% to \u20137.6%) in five of eight patients (62.5%). In a separate open-label extension study of ten patients, ages 13 to 18 years, who started a second course of Amnesteem 4 months after the first course, two patients showed a decrease in mean lumbar spine bone mineral density up to 3.25% (see PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use ). Spontaneous reports of osteoporosis, osteopenia, bone fractures and delayed healing of bone fractures have been seen in the Amnesteem population. While causality to Amnesteem has not been established, an effect cannot be ruled out. Longer term effects have not been studied. It is important that Amnesteem be given at the recommended doses for no longer than the recommended duration. Hyperostosis A high prevalence of skeletal hyperostosis was noted in clinical trials for disorders of keratinization with a mean dose of 2.24 mg/kg/day. Additionally, skeletal hyperostosis was noted in six of eight patients in a prospective study of disorders of keratinization. 6 Minimal skeletal hyperostosis and calcification of ligaments and tendons have also been observed by x-ray in prospective studies of nodular acne patients treated with a single course of therapy at recommended doses. The skeletal effects of multiple Amnesteem treatment courses for acne are unknown. In a clinical study of 217 pediatric patients (12 to 17 years) with severe recalcitrant nodular acne, hyperostosis was not observed after 16 to 20 weeks of treatment with approximately 1 mg/kg/day of Amnesteem given in two divided doses. Hyperostosis may require a longer time frame to appear. The clinical course and significance remain unknown. Premature Epiphyseal Closure There are spontaneous reports of premature epiphyseal closure in acne patients receiving recommended doses of Amnesteem. The effect of multiple courses of Amnesteem on epiphyseal closure is unknown. Vision Impairment Visual problems should be carefully monitored. All Amnesteem patients experiencing visual difficulties should discontinue Amnesteem treatment and have an ophthalmological examination (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Special Senses ). Corneal Opacities Corneal opacities have occurred in patients receiving Amnesteem for acne and more frequently when higher drug dosages were used in patients with disorders of keratinization. The corneal opacities that have been observed in clinical trial patients treated with Amnesteem have either completely resolved or were resolving at follow-up 6 to 7 weeks after discontinuation of the drug (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Special Senses ). Decreased Night Vision Decreased night vision has been reported during Amnesteem therapy and in some instances the event has persisted after therapy was discontinued. Because the onset in some patients was sudden, patients should be advised of this potential problem and warned to be cautious when driving or operating any vehicle at night."

In studies comparing 0.1, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg/day, 8 it was found that all dosages provided initial clearing of disease, but there was a greater need for retreatment with the lower dosages. During treatment, the dose may be adjusted according to response of the disease and/or the appearance of clinical side effects \u2014 some of which may be dose related. Adult patients whose disease is very severe with scarring or is primarily manifested on the trunk may require dose adjustments up to 2 mg/kg/day, as tolerated. Failure to take Amnesteem with food will significantly decrease absorption. Before upward dose adjustments are made, the patients should be questioned about their compliance with food instructions. The safety of once daily dosing with Amnesteem has not been established. Once daily dosing is not recommended. If the total nodule count has been reduced by more than 70% prior to completing 15 to 20 weeks of treatment, the drug may be discontinued. After a period of 2 months or more off therapy, and if warranted by persistent or recurring severe nodular acne, a second course of therapy may be initiated. The optimal interval before retreatment has not been defined for patients who have not completed skeletal growth. Long-term use of Amnesteem, even in low doses, has not been studied, and is not recommended. It is important that Amnesteem be given at the recommended doses for no longer than the recommended duration. The effect of long-term use of Amnesteem on bone loss is unknown (see WARNINGS: Skeletal: Bone Mineral Density , Hyperostosis , and Premature Epiphyseal Closure ). Contraceptive measures must be followed for any subsequent course of therapy (see PRECAUTIONS ). Table 4.

      "laboratory_tests": [
        "Laboratory Tests Pregnancy Test Female patients of childbearing potential must have had two negative urine or serum pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL before receiving the initial Amnesteem prescription. The first test (a screening test) is obtained by the prescriber when the decision is made to pursue qualification of the patient for Amnesteem. The second pregnancy test (a confirmation test) must be done in a CLIA-certified laboratory. The interval between the two tests must be at least 19 days. For patients with regular menstrual cycles, the second pregnancy test must be done during the first 5 days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of Amnesteem therapy and after the patient has used 2 forms of contraception for 1 month. For patients with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding, the second pregnancy test must be done immediately preceding the beginning of Amnesteem therapy and after the patient has used 2 forms of contraception for 1 month. Each month of therapy, patients must have a negative result from a urine or serum pregnancy test. A pregnancy test must be repeated each month, in a CLIA-certified laboratory, prior to the female patient receiving each prescription. Lipids Pretreatment and follow-up blood lipids should be obtained under fasting conditions. After consumption of alcohol, at least 36 hours should elapse before these determinations are made. It is recommended that these tests be performed at weekly or biweekly intervals until the lipid response to Amnesteem is established. The incidence of hypertriglyceridemia is one patient in four on Amnesteem therapy (see WARNINGS: Lipids ). Liver Function Tests Since elevations of liver enzymes have been observed during clinical trials, and hepatitis has been reported, pretreatment and follow-up liver function tests should be performed at weekly or biweekly intervals until the response to Amnesteem has been established (see WARNINGS: Hepatotoxicity ). Glucose Some patients receiving Amnesteem have experienced problems in the control of their blood sugar. In addition, new cases of diabetes have been diagnosed during Amnesteem therapy, although no causal relationship has been established. CPK Some patients undergoing vigorous physical activity while on Amnesteem therapy have experienced elevated CPK levels; however, the clinical significance is unknown. There have been rare post-marketing reports of rhabdomyolysis, some associated with strenuous physical activity. In a clinical trial of 217 pediatric patients (12 to 17 years) with severe recalcitrant nodular acne, transient elevations in CPK were observed in 12% of patients, including those undergoing strenuous physical activity in association with reported musculoskeletal adverse events such as back pain, arthralgia, limb injury, or muscle sprain. In these patients, approximately half of the CPK elevations returned to normal within 2 weeks and half returned to normal within 4 weeks. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported in this trial."

        "Information for Patients See PRECAUTIONS and Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS . Patients must be instructed to read the Medication Guide supplied as required by law when Amnesteem is dispensed. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document. For additional information, patients must also be instructed to read the iPLEDGE program patient educational materials. All patients must sign the Patient Information/Informed Consent (for all patients) form. Female patients of childbearing potential must be instructed that they must not be pregnant when Amnesteem therapy is initiated, and that they should use two forms of effective contraception simultaneously for one month before starting Amnesteem, while taking Amnesteem, and for one month after Amnesteem has been stopped, unless they commit to continuous abstinence from heterosexual intercourse. They should also sign a second Patient Information/Informed Consent About Birth Defects (for female patients who can get pregnant) form prior to beginning Amnesteem therapy. They should be given an opportunity to view the patient DVD provided by the manufacturer to the prescriber. The DVD includes information about contraception, the most common reasons that contraception fails, and the importance of using two forms of effective contraception when taking teratogenic drugs and comprehensive information about types of potential birth defects which could occur if a female patient who is pregnant takes Amnesteem at any time during pregnancy. Female patients should be seen by their prescribers monthly and have a urine or serum pregnancy test, in a CLIA-certified laboratory, performed each month during treatment to confirm negative pregnancy status before another Amnesteem prescription is written (see Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Amnesteem is found in the semen of male patients taking Amnesteem, but the amount delivered to a female partner would be about one million times lower than an oral dose of 40 mg. While the no-effect limit for isotretinoin induced embryopathy is unknown, 20 years of post-marketing reports include four with isolated defects compatible with features of retinoid exposed fetuses; however two of these reports were incomplete and two had other possible explanations for the defects observed. Prescribers should be alert to the warning signs of psychiatric disorders to guide patients to receive the help they need. Therefore, prior to initiation of Amnesteem treatment, patients and family members should be asked about any history of psychiatric disorder, and at each visit during treatment patients should be assessed for symptoms of depression, mood disturbance, psychosis or aggression to determine if further evaluation may be necessary. Signs and symptoms of depression include sad mood, hopelessness, feelings of guilt, worthlessness or helplessness, loss of pleasure or interest in activities, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, change in sleep pattern, change in weight or appetite, suicidal thoughts or attempts, restlessness, irritability, acting on dangerous impulses and persistent physical symptoms unresponsive to treatment. Patients should stop Amnesteem and the patient or a family member should promptly contact their prescriber if the patient develops depression, mood disturbance, psychosis or aggression, without waiting until the next visit. Discontinuation of Amnesteem treatment may be insufficient; further evaluation may be necessary. While such monitoring may be helpful, it may not detect all patients at risk. Patients may report mental health problems or family history of psychiatric disorders. These reports should be discussed with the patient and/or the patient\u2019s family. A referral to a mental health professional may be necessary. The physician should consider whether Amnesteem therapy is appropriate in this setting; for some patients the risks may outweigh the benefits of Amnesteem therapy. Patients must be informed that some patients, while taking Amnesteem or soon after stopping Amnesteem, have become depressed or developed other serious mental problems. Symptoms of depression include sad, \u201canxious\u201d or empty mood, irritability, acting on dangerous impulses, anger, loss of pleasure or interest in social or sports activities, sleeping too much or too little, changes in weight or appetite, school or work performance going down or trouble concentrating. Some patients taking Amnesteem have had thoughts about hurting themselves or putting an end to their own lives (suicidal thoughts). Some people tried to end their own lives. And some people have ended their own lives. There were reports that some of these people did not appear depressed. There have been reports of patients on Amnesteem becoming aggressive or violent. No one knows if Amnesteem caused these behaviors or if they would have happened even if the person did not take Amnesteem. Some people have had other signs of depression while taking Amnesteem. Patients must be informed that they must not share Amnesteem with anyone else because of the risk of birth defects and other serious adverse events. Patients must be informed not to donate blood during therapy and for one month following discontinuation of the drug because the blood might be given to a pregnant female patient whose fetus must not be exposed to Amnesteem. Patients should be reminded to take Amnesteem with a meal (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). To decrease the risk of esophageal irritation, patients should swallow the capsules with a full glass of liquid. Patients should be informed that transient exacerbation (flare) of acne has been seen, generally during the initial period of therapy. Wax epilation and skin resurfacing procedures (such as dermabrasion, laser) should be avoided during Amnesteem therapy and for at least 6 months thereafter due to the possibility of scarring (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Skin and Appendages ). Patients should be advised to avoid prolonged exposure to UV rays or sunlight. Patients should be informed that they may experience decreased tolerance to contact lenses during and after therapy. Patients should be informed that approximately 16% of patients treated with Amnesteem in a clinical trial developed musculoskeletal symptoms (including arthralgia) during treatment. In general, these symptoms were mild to moderate, but occasionally required discontinuation of the drug. Transient pain in the chest has been reported less frequently. In the clinical trial, these symptoms generally cleared rapidly after discontinuation of Amnesteem, but in some cases persisted (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Musculoskeletal ). There have been rare post-marketing reports of rhabdomyolysis, some associated with strenuous physical activity (see Laboratory Tests: CPK ). Pediatric patients and their caregivers should be informed that approximately 29% (104/358) of pediatric patients treated with Amnesteem developed back pain. Back pain was severe in 13.5% (14/104) of the cases and occurred at a higher frequency in female patients than male patients. Arthralgias were experienced in 22% (79/358) of pediatric patients. Arthralgias were severe in 7.6% (6/79) of patients. Appropriate evaluation of the musculoskeletal system should be done in patients who present with these symptoms during or after a course of Amnesteem. Consideration should be given to discontinuation of Amnesteem if any significant abnormality is found. Neutropenia and rare cases of agranulocytosis have been reported. Amnesteem should be discontinued if clinically significant decreases in white cell counts occur. Patients should be advised that severe skin reactions (Steven-Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) have been reported in post-marketing data. Amnesteem should be discontinued if clinically significant skin reactions occur."

        "MEDICATION GUIDE AMNESTEEM (AM-NES-TEAM) (Isotretinoin Capsules) Read the Medication Guide that comes with Amnesteem before you start taking it and each time you get a prescription. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking with your doctor about your medical condition or your treatment. What is the most important information I should know about Amnesteem? Amnesteem \u00ae is used to treat a type of severe acne (nodular acne) that has not been helped by other treatments, including antibiotics. Because Amnesteem can cause birth defects, Amnesteem is only for patients who can understand and agree to carry out all of the instructions in the iPLEDGE program. Amnesteem may cause serious mental health problems. Birth defects (deformed babies), loss of a baby before birth (miscarriage), death of the baby and early (premature) births. Female patients who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant must not take Amnesteem. Female patients must not get pregn1: for 1 month before starting Amnesteem while taking Amnesteem for 1 month after stopping Amnesteem. If you get pregnant while taking Amnesteem, stop taking it right away and call your doctor. Doctors and patients should report all cases of pregnancy to: FDA MedWatch at 1-800-FDA-1088, and the iPLEDGE pregnancy registry at 1-866-495-0654 Serious mental health problems. Amnesteem may cause: depression psychosis (seeing or hearing things that are not real) suicide. Some patients taking Amnesteem have had thoughts about hurting themselves or putting an end to their own lives (suicidal thoughts). Some people tried to end their own lives. And some people have ended their own lives. Stop Amnesteem and call your doctor right away if you or a family member notices that you have any of the following signs and symptoms of depression or psychosis: start to feel sad or have crying spells lose interest in activities you once enjoyed sleep too much or have trouble sleeping become more irritable, angry, or aggressive than usual (for example, temper outbursts, thoughts of violence) have a change in your appetite or body weight have trouble concentrating withdraw from your friends or family feel like you have no energy have feelings of worthlessness or guilt start having thoughts about hurting yourself or taking your own life (suicidal thoughts) start acting on dangerous impulses start seeing or hearing things that are not real After stopping Amnesteem, you may also need follow-up mental health care if you had any of these symptoms. What is Amnesteem? Amnesteem is a medicine taken by mouth to treat the most severe form of acne (nodular acne) that cannot be cleared up by any other acne treatments, including antibiotics. Amnesteem can cause serious side effects (see \u201cWhat is the most important information I should know about Amnesteem?\u201d ). Amnesteem can only be: prescribed by doctors that are registered in the iPLEDGE program dispensed by a pharmacy that is registered with the iPLEDGE program given to patients who are registered in the iPLEDGE program and agree to do everything required in the program What is severe nodular acne? Severe nodular acne is when many red, swollen, tender lumps form in the skin. These can be the size of pencil erasers or larger. If untreated, nodular acne can lead to permanent scars. Who should not take Amnesteem? Do not take Amnesteem if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant or become pregnant during Amnesteem treatment. Amnesteem causes severe birth defects. See \u201cWhat is the most important information I should know about Amnesteem?\u201d Do not take Amnesteem if you are allergic to anything in it. See the end of this Medication Guide for a complete list of ingredients in Amnesteem. What should I tell my doctor before taking Amnesteem? Tell your doctor if you or a family member has any of the following health conditions: mental problems asthma liver disease diabetes heart disease bone loss (osteoporosis) or weak bones an eating problem called anorexia nervosa (where people eat too little) food or medicine allergies Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. Amnesteem must not be used by women who are pregnant or breast-feeding. Tell your doctor about all of the medicines you take including prescription and non-prescription medicines, vitamins and herbal supplements. Amnesteem and certain other medicines can interact with each other, sometimes causing serious side effects. Especially tell your doctor if you take: Vitamin A supplements. Vitamin A in high doses has many of the same side effects as Amnesteem. Taking both together may increase your chance of getting side effects. Tetracycline antibiotics. Tetracycline antibiotics taken with Amnesteem can increase the chances of getting increased pressure in the brain. Progestin-only birth control pills (mini-pills). They may not work while you take Amnesteem. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure what type you are using. Dilantin (phenytoin). This medicine taken with Amnesteem may weaken your bones. Corticosteroid medicines. These medicines taken with Amnesteem may weaken your bones. St. John\u2019s Wort. This herbal supplement may make birth control pills work less effectively. These medicines should not be used with Amnesteem unless your doctor tells you it is okay. Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them to show to your doctor and pharmacist. Do not take any new medicine without talking with your doctor. How should I take Amnesteem? You must take Amnesteem exactly as prescribed. You must also follow all the instructions of the iPLEDGE program. Before prescribing Amnesteem, your doctor will: explain the iPLEDGE program to you have you sign the Patient Information/Informed Consent form (for all patients). Female patients who can get pregnant must also sign another consent form. You will not be prescribed Amnesteem if you cannot agree to or follow all the instructions of the iPLEDGE program. You will get no more than a 30 day supply of Amnesteem at a time. This is to make sure you are following the Amnesteem iPLEDGE program. You should talk with your doctor each month about side effects. The amount of Amnesteem you take has been specially chosen for you. It is based on your body weight, and may change during treatment. Take Amnesteem 2 times a day with a meal, unless your doctor tells you otherwise. Swallow your Amnesteem capsules whole with a full glass of liquid. Do not chew or suck on the capsule. Amnesteem can hurt the tube that connects your mouth to your stomach (esophagus) if it is not swallowed whole. If you miss a dose, just skip that dose. Do not take two doses at the same time. If you take too much Amnesteem or overdose, call your doctor or poison control center right away. Your acne may get worse when you first start taking Amnesteem. This should last only a short while. Talk with your doctor if this is a problem for you. You must return to your doctor as directed to make sure you don\u2019t have signs of serious side effects. Your doctor may do blood tests to check for serious side effects from Amnesteem. Female patients who can get pregnant will get a pregnancy test each month. Female patients who can get pregnant must agree to use two separate forms of effective birth control at the same time one month before, while taking and for one month after taking Amnesteem. You must access the iPLEDGE system to answer questions about the program requirements and to enter your two chosen forms of birth control. To access the iPLEDGE system, go to www.ipledgeprogram.com or call 1-866-495-0654. You must talk about effective birth control methods with your doctor or go for a free visit to talk about birth control with another doctor or family planning expert. Your doctor can arrange this free visit, which will be paid for by the company that makes Amnesteem. If you have sex at any time without using two forms of effective birth control, get pregnant or miss your expected period, stop using Amnesteem and call your doctor right away. What should I avoid while taking Amnesteem? Do not get pregnant while taking Amnesteem and for one month after stopping Amnesteem. See \u201cWhat is the most important information I should know about Amnesteem?\u201d Do not breast-feed while taking Amnesteem and for one month after stopping Amnesteem. We do not know if Amnesteem can pass through your milk and harm the baby. Do not give blood while you take Amnesteem and for one month after stopping Amnesteem. If someone who is pregnant gets your donated blood, her baby may be exposed to Amnesteem and may be born with birth defects. Do not take other medicines or herbal products with Amnesteem unless you talk to your doctor. See \u201cWhat should I tell my doctor before taking Amnesteem?\u201d Do not drive at night until you know if Amnesteem has affected your vision. Amnesteem may decrease your ability to see in the dark. Do not have cosmetic procedures to smooth your skin, including waxing, dermabrasion, or laser procedures, while you are using Amnesteem and for at least 6 months after you stop. Amnesteem can increase your chance of scarring from these procedures. Check with your doctor for advice about when you can have cosmetic procedures. Avoid sunlight and ultraviolet lights as much as possible. Tanning machines use ultraviolet lights. Amnesteem may make your skin more sensitive to light. Do not share Amnesteem with other people. It can cause birth defects and other serious health problems. What are the possible side effects of Amnesteem? Amnesteem can cause birth defects (deformed babies), loss of a baby before birth (miscarriage), death of the baby and early (premature) births. See \u201cWhat is the most important information I should know about Amnesteem?\u201d Amnesteem may cause serious mental health problems. See \u201cWhat is the most important information I should know about Amnesteem?\u201d serious brain problems. Amnesteem can increase the pressure in your brain. This can lead to permanent loss of eyesight and, in rare cases, death. Stop taking Amnesteem and call your doctor right away if you get any of these signs of increased brain pressure: bad headache blurred vision dizziness nausea or vomiting seizures (convulsions) stroke skin problems. Skin rash can occur in patients taking Amnesteem. In some patients a rash can be serious. Stop using Amnesteem and call your doctor right away if you develop conjunctivitis (red or inflamed eyes, like \u201cpink eye\u201d), a rash with a fever, blisters on legs, arms or face and/or sores in your mouth, throat, nose, eyes, or if your skin begins to peel. stomach area (abdomen) problems . Certain symptoms may mean that your internal organs are being damaged. These organs include the liver, pancreas, bowel (intestines) and esophagus (connection between mouth and stomach). If your organs are damaged, they may not get better even after you stop taking Amnesteem. Stop taking Amnesteem and call your doctor if you get: severe stomach, chest or bowel pain trouble swallowing or painful swallowing new or worsening heartburn diarrhea rectal bleeding yellowing of your skin or eyes dark urine bone and muscle problems. Amnesteem may affect bones, muscles, and ligaments and cause pain in your joints or muscles. Tell your doctor if you plan hard physical activity during treatment with Amnesteem.

        "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Isotretinoin is a retinoid, which when administered in pharmacologic dosages of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ), inhibits sebaceous gland function and keratinization. The exact mechanism of action of isotretinoin is unknown. Nodular Acne Clinical improvement in nodular acne patients occurs in association with a reduction in sebum secretion. The decrease in sebum secretion is temporary and is related to the dose and duration of treatment with Amnesteem, and reflects a reduction in sebaceous gland size and an inhibition of sebaceous gland differentiation. 1 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Due to its high lipophilicity, oral absorption of isotretinoin is enhanced when given with a high fat meal. In a crossover study, 74 healthy adult subjects received a single 80 mg oral dose (2 x 40 mg capsules) of Amnesteem under fasted and fed conditions. Both peak plasma concentration (C max ) and the total exposure (AUC) of isotretinoin were more than doubled following a standardized high fat meal when compared with Amnesteem given under fasted conditions (see Table 2 ). The observed elimination half-life was unchanged. This lack of change in half-life suggests that food increases the bioavailability of isotretinoin without altering its disposition. The time to peak concentration (T max ) was also increased with food and may be related to a longer absorption phase. Therefore, Amnesteem capsules should always be taken with food (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Clinical studies have shown that there is no difference in the pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin between patients with nodular acne and healthy subjects with normal skin. Table 2. Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Isotretinoin Mean (%CV), N = 74 Amnesteem 2 x 40 mg Capsules AUC 0-\u221e (ng\u2022hr/mL) C max (ng/mL) T max (hr) t 1/2 (hr) Fed 10,004 (22%) 862 (22%) 5.3 (77%) 21 (39%) Fasted 3,703 (46%) 301 (63%) 3.2 (56%) 21 (30%) Distribution Isotretinoin is more than 99.9% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin. Metabolism Following oral administration of isotretinoin, at least three metabolites have been identified in human plasma: 4- oxo -isotretinoin, retinoic acid (tretinoin), and 4- oxo -retinoic acid (4- oxo -tretinoin). Retinoic acid and 13- cis -retinoic acid are geometric isomers and show reversible interconversion. The administration of one isomer will give rise to the other. Isotretinoin is also irreversibly oxidized to 4- oxo -isotretinoin, which forms its geometric isomer 4- oxo -tretinoin. After a single 80 mg oral dose of Amnesteem to 74 healthy adult subjects, concurrent administration of food increased the extent of formation of all metabolites in plasma when compared to the extent of formation under fasted conditions. All of these metabolites possess retinoid activity that is in some in vitro models more than that of the parent isotretinoin. However, the clinical significance of these models is unknown. After multiple oral dose administration of isotretinoin to adult cystic acne patients (\u2265 18 years), the exposure of patients to 4- oxo -isotretinoin at steady-state under fasted and fed conditions was approximately 3.4 times higher than that of isotretinoin. In vitro studies indicate that the primary P450 isoforms involved in isotretinoin metabolism are 2C8, 2C9, 3A4 and 2B6. Isotretinoin and its metabolites are further metabolized into conjugates, which are then excreted in urine and feces. Elimination Following oral administration of an 80 mg dose of 14 C-isotretinoin as a liquid suspension, 14 C-activity in blood declined with a half-life of 90 hours. The metabolites of isotretinoin and any conjugates are ultimately excreted in the feces and urine in relatively equal amounts (total of 65% to 83%). After a single 80 mg oral dose of Amnesteem to 74 healthy adult subjects under fed conditions, the mean \u00b1 SD elimination half-lives (t 1/2 ) of isotretinoin and 4- oxo -isotretinoin were 21 \u00b1 8.2 hours and 24 \u00b1 5.3 hours, respectively. After both single and multiple doses, the observed accumulation ratios of isotretinoin ranged from 0.9 to 5.43 in patients with cystic acne. Special Patient Populations Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin were evaluated after single and multiple doses in 38 pediatric patients (12 to 15 years) and 19 adult patients (\u2265 18 years) who received Amnesteem for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne. In both age groups, 4- oxo -isotretinoin was the major metabolite; tretinoin and 4- oxo -tretinoin were also observed. The dose-normalized pharmacokinetic parameters for isotretinoin following single and multiple doses are summarized in Table 3 for pediatric patients. There were no statistically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin between pediatric and adult patients. Table 3. Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Isotretinoin Following Single and Multiple Dose Administration in Pediatric Patients, 12 to 15 Years of Age Mean (\u00b1 SD), N = 38 Parameter Isotretinoin (Single Dose) Isotretinoin (Steady-State) C max (ng/mL) AUC (0 to 12) (ng . hr/mL) AUC (0 to 24) (ng . hr/mL) T max (hr) Css min (ng/mL) T 1/2 (hr) CL/F (L/hr) 573.25 (278.79) 3033.37 (1394.17) 6003.81 (2885.67) 6 (1 - 24.6) \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 731.98 (361.86) 5082 (2184.23) \u2013 4 (0 to 12) 352.32 (184.44) 15.69 (5.12) 17.96 (6.27) In pediatric patients (12 to 15 years), the mean \u00b1 SD elimination half-lives (t 1/2 ) of isotretinoin and 4- oxo -isotretinoin were 15.7 \u00b1 5.1 hours and 23.1 \u00b1 5.7 hours, respectively. The accumulation ratios of isotretinoin ranged from 0.46 to 3.65 for pediatric patients."

        "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In male and female Fischer 344 rats given oral isotretinoin at dosages of 8 or 32 mg/kg/day (1.3 to 5.3 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area) for greater than 18 months, there was a dose related increased incidence of pheochromocytoma relative to controls. The incidence of adrenal medullary hyperplasia was also increased at the higher dosage in both sexes. The relatively high level of spontaneous pheochromocytomas occurring in the male Fischer 344 rat makes it an equivocal model for study of this tumor; therefore, the relevance of this tumor to the human population is uncertain. The Ames test was conducted with isotretinoin in two laboratories. The results of the tests in one laboratory were negative while in the second laboratory a weakly positive response (less than 1.6 x background) was noted in S. typhimurium TA100 when the assay was conducted with metabolic activation. No dose-response effect was seen and all other strains were negative. Additionally, other tests designed to assess genotoxicity (Chinese hamster cell assay, mouse micronucleus test, S. cerevisiae D7 assay, in vitro clastogenesis assay with human-derived lymphocytes and unscheduled DNA synthesis assay) were all negative. In rats, no adverse effects on gonadal function, fertility, conception rate, gestation or parturition were observed at oral dosages of isotretinoin of 2, 8 or 32 mg/kg/day (0.3, 1.3 or 5.3 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area). In dogs, testicular atrophy was noted after treatment with oral isotretinoin for approximately 30 weeks at dosages of 20 or 60 mg/kg/day (10 or 30 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mg/kg/day, respectively, after normalization for total body surface area). In general, there was microscopic evidence for appreciable depression of spermatogenesis but some sperm were observed in all testes examined and in no instance were completely atrophic tubules seen. In studies of 66 men, 30 of whom were patients with nodular acne under treatment with oral isotretinoin, no significant changes were noted in the count or motility of spermatozoa in the ejaculate. In a study of 50 men (ages 17 to 32 years) receiving Amnesteem (isotretinoin) therapy for nodular acne, no significant effects were seen on ejaculate volume, sperm count, total sperm motility, morphology or seminal plasma fructose."

      "overdosage": [
        "OVERDOSAGE The oral LD 50 of isotretinoin is greater than 4000 mg/kg in rats and mice (> 600 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mg/kg/day after normalization of the rat dose for total body surface area and > 300 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mg/kg/day after normalization of the mouse dose for total body surface area) and is approximately 1960 mg/kg in rabbits (653 times the recommended clinical dose of 1 mg/kg/day after normalization for total body surface area). In humans, overdosage has been associated with vomiting, facial flushing, cheilosis, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness and ataxia. These symptoms quickly resolve without apparent residual effects. Amnesteem causes serious birth defects at any dosage (see Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS ). Female patients of childbearing potential who present with isotretinoin overdose must be evaluated for pregnancy. Patients who are pregnant should receive counseling about the risks to the fetus, as described in the Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS . Non-pregnant patients must be warned to avoid pregnancy for at least one month and receive contraceptive counseling as described in PRECAUTIONS . Educational materials for such patients can be obtained by calling the manufacturer. Because an overdose would be expected to result in higher levels of isotretinoin in semen than found during a normal treatment course, male patients should use a condom, or avoid reproductive sexual activity with a female patient who is or might become pregnant, for one month after the overdose. All patients with isotretinoin overdose should not donate blood for at least one month."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Lanthanum in FOSRENOL has the potential to bind to drugs with anionic (e.g., carboxyl, carbonyl and hydroxyl) groups. FOSRENOL may decrease the bioavailability of tetracyclines or fluoroquinolones via this mechanism. There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between FOSRENOL and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medications where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy, consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs. The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate release or an extended release product. Consider monitoring clinical responses or blood levels of concomitant medications that have a narrow therapeutic range. There is a potential for FOSRENOL to interact with compounds that bind to cationic antacids (i.e., aluminum-, magnesium-, or calcium-based). Therefore, do not take such compounds within 2 hours of dosing with FOSRENOL. ( 7.1 ) Oral quinolone antibiotics must be taken at least 1 hour before or 4 hours after FOSRENOL. ( 7.2 ) Do not take thyroid hormone replacement therapy within 2 hours of dosing with FOSRENOL. Monitoring of TSH levels is recommended in patients receiving both medicinal agents. ( 7.3 ) 7.1 Drugs Binding to Antacids There is a potential for FOSRENOL to interact with compounds which bind to cationic antacids (i.e., aluminum-, magnesium-, or calcium-based). Therefore, do not administer such compounds within 2 hours of dosing with FOSRENOL. Examples of relevant classes of compounds where antacids have been demonstrated to reduce bioavailability include antibiotics (such as quinolones, ampicillin and tetracyclines), thyroid hormones, ACE-inhibitors, statin lipid regulators and anti-malarials. 7.2 Quinolone Antibiotics Co-administration of FOSRENOL with quinolone antibiotics may reduce the extent of their absorption. The bioavailability of oral ciprofloxacin was decreased by approximately 50% when taken with FOSRENOL in a single dose study in healthy volunteers. Administer oral quinolone antibiotics at least 1 hour before or 4 hours after FOSRENOL. When oral quinolones are given for short courses, consider eliminating the doses of FOSRENOL that would be normally scheduled near the time of quinolone intake to improve quinolone absorption [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.3 Levothyroxine The bioavailability of levothyroxine was decreased by approximately 40% when taken together with FOSRENOL. Administer thyroid hormone replacement therapy at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after dosing with FOSRENOL and monitor thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "pharmacodynamics": [
        "12.2 Pharmacodynamics In vitro studies have shown that lanthanum binds phosphate in the physiologically relevant pH range of 3 to 7. In simulated gastric fluid, lanthanum binds approximately 97% of the available phosphate at pH 3-5 and 67% at pH 7, when lanthanum is present in a two-fold molar excess to phosphate. Bile acids have not been shown to affect the phosphate binding affinity of lanthanum. In order to bind dietary phosphate, FOSRENOL must be administered with or immediately after meals. In five Phase I pharmacodynamic studies comparing the reduction from baseline of urinary phosphorus excretion in healthy volunteers (N=143 taking lanthanum carbonate), it was shown that the mean intestinal phosphate binding capacity of lanthanum ranged from 235 to 468 mg phosphorus/day when lanthanum was administered at a dose of 3 g per day with food. By comparison, in one study with an untreated control group (n=10) and another study with a placebo group (n=3), the corresponding mean changes from baseline were 3 mg phosphorus/day and 87 mg phosphorus/day, respectively. In healthy subjects FOSRENOL Oral Powder was found to be similar to FOSRENOL Chewable Tablets, based on urinary phosphate excretion."

Lanthanum carbonate is described as white to almost white powder. Lanthanum carbonate is practically insoluble in water and is insoluble in organic solvents; it dissolves in dilute mineral acids with effervescence. Each FOSRENOL, white to off-white, chewable tablet contains lanthanum carbonate hydrate equivalent to 500, 750, or 1000 mg of elemental lanthanum and the following inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide NF, dextrates (hydrated) NF, magnesium stearate NF. FOSRENOL Oral Powder is a white to off-white powder containing lanthanum carbonate hydrate equivalent to 750 or 1000 mg of elemental lanthanum and the following inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide NF, dextrates (hydrated) NF, magnesium stearate NF."

        "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Oral administration of lanthanum carbonate to rats for up to 104 weeks, at doses up to 1500 mg of the salt per kg/day [2.5 times the MRHD of 5725 mg, on a mg/m 2 basis, assuming a 60-kg patient] revealed no evidence of carcinogenic potential. In the mouse, oral administration of lanthanum carbonate for up to 99 weeks, at a dose of 1500 mg/kg/day (1.3 times the MRHD) was associated with an increased incidence of glandular stomach adenomas in male mice. Lanthanum carbonate tested negative for mutagenic activity in an in vitro Ames assay using Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli strains and in vitro HGPRT gene mutation and chromosomal aberration assays in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Lanthanum carbonate also tested negative in an oral mouse micronucleus assay at doses up to 2000 mg/kg (1.7 times the MRHD), and in micronucleus and unscheduled DNA synthesis assays in rats given IV lanthanum chloride at doses up to 0.1 mg/kg, a dose that produced plasma lanthanum concentrations >2000 times the peak human plasma concentration. Lanthanum carbonate, at doses up to 2000 mg/kg/day (3.4 times the MRHD), did not affect fertility or mating performance of male or female rats. 13.3 Developmental Toxicity In pregnant rats, oral administration of lanthanum carbonate at doses as high as 2000 mg/kg/day (3.4 times the MRHD) resulted in no evidence of harm to the fetus. In pregnant rabbits, oral administration of lanthanum carbonate at 1500 mg/kg/day (5 times the MRHD) was associated with a reduction in maternal body weight gain and food consumption, increased post-implantation loss, reduced fetal weights, and delayed fetal ossification. Lanthanum carbonate administered to rats from implantation through lactation at 2000 mg/kg/day (3.4 times the MRHD) caused delayed eye opening, reduction in body weight gain, and delayed sexual development (preputial separation and vaginal opening) of the offspring."

      "mechanism_of_action": [
        "12.1 Mechanism of Action FOSRENOL is a phosphate binder that reduces absorption of phosphate by forming insoluble lanthanum phosphate complexes that pass through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract unabsorbed. Both serum phosphate and calcium phosphate product are reduced as a consequence of the reduced dietary phosphate absorption."
      ],
      "pharmacokinetics": [
        "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Distribution - Following single or multiple dose oral administration of FOSRENOL to healthy subjects, the concentration of lanthanum in plasma was very low (bioavailability <0.002%). Following oral administration in patients, the mean lanthanum C max was 1.0 ng/mL. During long-term administration (52 weeks) in ESRD patients, the mean lanthanum concentration in plasma was approximately 0.6 ng/mL. There was minimal increase in plasma lanthanum concentrations with increasing doses within the therapeutic dose range. The timing of food intake relative to lanthanum administration (during and 30 minutes after food intake) has a negligible effect on the systemic level of lanthanum. Systemic exposure to lanthanum was approximately 30% higher following administration of FOSRENOL Oral Powder when compared to FOSRENOL Chewable Tablets. However, systemic exposure to lanthanum from both formulations in this study was within the range seen in previous pharmacokinetic studies of Chewable Tablets in healthy individuals. In vitro , lanthanum is highly bound (>99%) to human plasma proteins, including human serum albumin, \u03b11-acid glycoprotein, and transferrin. Binding to erythrocytes in vivo is negligible in rats. In animal studies, lanthanum concentrations in several tissues, particularly gastrointestinal tract, mesenteric lymph nodes, bone and liver, increased over time to levels several orders of magnitude higher than those in plasma. The level of lanthanum in the liver was higher in renally impaired rats due to higher intestinal absorption. Lanthanum was found in the lysosomes and the biliary canal consistent with transcellular transport. Steady state tissue concentrations in bone and liver were achieved in dogs between 4 and 26 weeks. Relatively high levels of lanthanum remained in these tissues for longer than 6 months after cessation of dosing in dogs. There is no evidence from animal studies that lanthanum crosses the blood-brain barrier. In 105 bone biopsies from patients treated with FOSRENOL for up to 4.5 years, rising levels of lanthanum were noted over time. Estimates of elimination half-life from bone ranged from 2.0 to 3.6 years. Steady state bone concentrations were not reached during the period studied. Metabolism and Elimination - Lanthanum is not metabolized. Lanthanum was cleared from plasma of patients undergoing dialysis with an elimination half-life of 53 hours following discontinuation of therapy. No information is available regarding the mass balance of lanthanum in humans after oral administration. In rats and dogs, the mean recovery of lanthanum after an oral dose was about 99% and 94%, respectively, and was essentially all from feces. Biliary excretion is the predominant route of elimination for circulating lanthanum in rats. In healthy volunteers administered intravenous lanthanum as the soluble chloride salt (120 \u00b5g), renal clearance was less than 2% of total plasma clearance. Drug Interactions FOSRENOL has a low potential for systemic drug-drug interactions because of the very low bioavailability of lanthanum and because it is not a substrate or inhibitor of major cytochrome P450 enzyme groups involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C9/10, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5). FOSRENOL does not alter gastric pH. Therefore, FOSRENOL drug interactions based on altered gastric pH are not expected. In an in vitro investigation, lanthanum did not form insoluble complexes when mixed in simulated gastric fluid with warfarin, digoxin, furosemide, phenytoin, metoprolol and enalapril. Clinical studies have shown that FOSRENOL (three doses of 1000 mg on the day prior to exposure and one dose of 1000 mg on the day of co-administration) administered 30 minutes earlier did not alter the pharmacokinetics of oral warfarin (10 mg), digoxin (0.5 mg), or metoprolol (100 mg). Potential pharmacodynamic interactions between lanthanum and these drugs (e.g., bleeding time or prothrombin time) were not evaluated. None of the drug interaction studies were done with the maximum recommended therapeutic dose of lanthanum carbonate. No drug interaction studies assessed the effects of drugs on phosphate binding by lanthanum carbonate. Ciprofloxacin In a randomized, two\u2013way crossover study in healthy volunteers examining the interaction potential of a single oral dose of ciprofloxacin (750 mg) alone and with lanthanum carbonate (1 g TID), the maximum plasma concentration of ciprofloxacin was reduced by 56% and the area under the ciprofloxacin plasma concentration-time curve was reduced by 54%. The 24-h urinary recovery of ciprofloxacin was reduced 52% by FOSRENOL [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Levothyroxine In a single-dose crossover study of levothyroxine (1 mg) with or without simultaneous administration of a single dose of FOSRENOL (500 mg) in six euthyroid normal healthy volunteers, the area under the serum T4 concentration-time curve was decreased by 40% [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ] . Fat Soluble Vitamins FOSRENOL appears not to affect the availability of fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K) or other nutrients [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Citrate Citrate did not increase the absorption of lanthanum."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Gastrointestinal Adverse Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Overall, the safety profile of FOSRENOL has been studied in over 5200 subjects in completed clinical trials. The most common adverse reactions for FOSRENOL were gastrointestinal events, such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain and they generally abated over time with continued dosing. In controlled trials, the most common adverse reactions that were more frequent (\u2265 5% difference vs. placebo) in FOSRENOL were nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. ( 6.1 ) The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of FOSRENOL: constipation, dyspepsia, allergic skin reactions, and tooth injury while chewing the tablet.

In double-blind, placebo-controlled studies where a total of 180 and 95 ESRD patients were randomized to FOSRENOL chewable tablet and placebo, respectively, for 4-6 weeks of treatment, the most common reactions that were more frequent (\u22655% difference) in the FOSRENOL group were nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain (Table 1).

The safety of FOSRENOL was studied in two long-term, open-labeled clinical trials, which included 1215 patients treated with FOSRENOL and 944 with alternative therapy. Fourteen percent (14%) of FOSRENOL treated patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Gastrointestinal adverse reactions, such as nausea, diarrhea and vomiting were the most common types of event leading to discontinuation. In pooled active comparator controlled clinical trials, hypocalcemia was noted with an incidence of approximately 5% in both lanthanum and active comparator groups. A nonclinical study and a phase 1 study have shown reduced absorption of calcium in the intestine with lanthanum carbonate treatment. In a crossover study in 72 healthy individuals comparing Fosrenol chewable tablets to Fosrenol oral powder, gastrointestinal adverse reactions such as nausea, diarrhea and vomiting were more common for the oral powder formulation (18%) than for the chewable tablets (7%). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of FOSRENOL. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: constipation, intestinal perforation, intestinal obstruction, ileus, subileus, dyspepsia, allergic skin reactions, hypophosphatemia, and tooth injury while chewing the tablet."

Fifty-five percent of subjects were male, 71% black, 25% white and 4% of other races. The mean age was 56 years and the duration of dialysis ranged from 0.5 to 15.3 years. Steady-state effects were achieved after two weeks. The effect after six weeks of treatment is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. Difference in Phosphate Reduction in the FOSRENOL and Placebo Group in a 6-Week, Dose-Ranging, Double-Blind Study in ESRD Patients (with 95% Confidence Intervals) One-hundred and eighty-five patients with end stage renal disease undergoing either hemodialysis (n=146) or peritoneal dialysis (n=39) were enrolled in two placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal studies. Sixty-four percent of subjects were male, 28% black, 62% white and 10% of other races. The mean age was 58.4 years and the duration of dialysis ranged from 0.2 to 21.4 years. After titration of lanthanum carbonate to achieve a phosphate level between 4.0 and 5.6 mg/dL in one study (doses up to 2250 mg/day) or \u22645.9 mg/dL in the second study (doses up to 3000 mg/day) and maintenance through 6 weeks, patients were randomized to lanthanum or placebo. During the placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal phase (four weeks), the phosphorus concentration rose in the placebo group by 1.7 mg/dL in one study and 1.9 mg/dL in the other study relative to patients who remained on lanthanum carbonate therapy. figure 1 14.2 Open-Label Active-Controlled Studies Two long-term open-label studies were conducted, involving a total of 2028 patients with ESRD undergoing hemodialysis. Patients were randomized to receive FOSRENOL or alternative phosphate binders for up to six months in one study and two years in the other. The daily FOSRENOL doses, divided and taken with meals, ranged from 375 mg to 3000 mg. Doses were titrated to reduce serum phosphate levels to a target level. The daily doses of the alternative therapy were based on current prescribing information or those commonly utilized. Both treatment groups had similar reductions in serum phosphate of about 1.8 mg/dL. Maintenance of reduction was observed for up to three years in patients treated with FOSRENOL in long-term, open-label extensions. No effects of FOSRENOL on serum levels of 25-dihydroxy vitamin D3, vitamin A, vitamin B12, vitamin E and vitamin K were observed in patients who were monitored for 6 months. Paired bone biopsies (at baseline and at one or two years) in 69 patients randomized to either FOSRENOL or calcium carbonate in one study and 99 patients randomized to either FOSRENOL or alternative therapy in a second study showed no differences in the development of mineralization defects between the groups.

      "clinical_pharmacology": [
        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action FOSRENOL is a phosphate binder that reduces absorption of phosphate by forming insoluble lanthanum phosphate complexes that pass through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract unabsorbed. Both serum phosphate and calcium phosphate product are reduced as a consequence of the reduced dietary phosphate absorption. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In vitro studies have shown that lanthanum binds phosphate in the physiologically relevant pH range of 3 to 7. In simulated gastric fluid, lanthanum binds approximately 97% of the available phosphate at pH 3-5 and 67% at pH 7, when lanthanum is present in a two-fold molar excess to phosphate. Bile acids have not been shown to affect the phosphate binding affinity of lanthanum. In order to bind dietary phosphate, FOSRENOL must be administered with or immediately after meals. In five Phase I pharmacodynamic studies comparing the reduction from baseline of urinary phosphorus excretion in healthy volunteers (N=143 taking lanthanum carbonate), it was shown that the mean intestinal phosphate binding capacity of lanthanum ranged from 235 to 468 mg phosphorus/day when lanthanum was administered at a dose of 3 g per day with food. By comparison, in one study with an untreated control group (n=10) and another study with a placebo group (n=3), the corresponding mean changes from baseline were 3 mg phosphorus/day and 87 mg phosphorus/day, respectively. In healthy subjects FOSRENOL Oral Powder was found to be similar to FOSRENOL Chewable Tablets, based on urinary phosphate excretion. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Distribution - Following single or multiple dose oral administration of FOSRENOL to healthy subjects, the concentration of lanthanum in plasma was very low (bioavailability <0.002%). Following oral administration in patients, the mean lanthanum C max was 1.0 ng/mL. During long-term administration (52 weeks) in ESRD patients, the mean lanthanum concentration in plasma was approximately 0.6 ng/mL. There was minimal increase in plasma lanthanum concentrations with increasing doses within the therapeutic dose range. The timing of food intake relative to lanthanum administration (during and 30 minutes after food intake) has a negligible effect on the systemic level of lanthanum. Systemic exposure to lanthanum was approximately 30% higher following administration of FOSRENOL Oral Powder when compared to FOSRENOL Chewable Tablets. However, systemic exposure to lanthanum from both formulations in this study was within the range seen in previous pharmacokinetic studies of Chewable Tablets in healthy individuals. In vitro , lanthanum is highly bound (>99%) to human plasma proteins, including human serum albumin, \u03b11-acid glycoprotein, and transferrin. Binding to erythrocytes in vivo is negligible in rats. In animal studies, lanthanum concentrations in several tissues, particularly gastrointestinal tract, mesenteric lymph nodes, bone and liver, increased over time to levels several orders of magnitude higher than those in plasma. The level of lanthanum in the liver was higher in renally impaired rats due to higher intestinal absorption. Lanthanum was found in the lysosomes and the biliary canal consistent with transcellular transport. Steady state tissue concentrations in bone and liver were achieved in dogs between 4 and 26 weeks. Relatively high levels of lanthanum remained in these tissues for longer than 6 months after cessation of dosing in dogs. There is no evidence from animal studies that lanthanum crosses the blood-brain barrier. In 105 bone biopsies from patients treated with FOSRENOL for up to 4.5 years, rising levels of lanthanum were noted over time. Estimates of elimination half-life from bone ranged from 2.0 to 3.6 years. Steady state bone concentrations were not reached during the period studied. Metabolism and Elimination - Lanthanum is not metabolized. Lanthanum was cleared from plasma of patients undergoing dialysis with an elimination half-life of 53 hours following discontinuation of therapy. No information is available regarding the mass balance of lanthanum in humans after oral administration. In rats and dogs, the mean recovery of lanthanum after an oral dose was about 99% and 94%, respectively, and was essentially all from feces. Biliary excretion is the predominant route of elimination for circulating lanthanum in rats. In healthy volunteers administered intravenous lanthanum as the soluble chloride salt (120 \u00b5g), renal clearance was less than 2% of total plasma clearance. Drug Interactions FOSRENOL has a low potential for systemic drug-drug interactions because of the very low bioavailability of lanthanum and because it is not a substrate or inhibitor of major cytochrome P450 enzyme groups involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, CYP2C9/10, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5). FOSRENOL does not alter gastric pH. Therefore, FOSRENOL drug interactions based on altered gastric pH are not expected. In an in vitro investigation, lanthanum did not form insoluble complexes when mixed in simulated gastric fluid with warfarin, digoxin, furosemide, phenytoin, metoprolol and enalapril. Clinical studies have shown that FOSRENOL (three doses of 1000 mg on the day prior to exposure and one dose of 1000 mg on the day of co-administration) administered 30 minutes earlier did not alter the pharmacokinetics of oral warfarin (10 mg), digoxin (0.5 mg), or metoprolol (100 mg). Potential pharmacodynamic interactions between lanthanum and these drugs (e.g., bleeding time or prothrombin time) were not evaluated. None of the drug interaction studies were done with the maximum recommended therapeutic dose of lanthanum carbonate. No drug interaction studies assessed the effects of drugs on phosphate binding by lanthanum carbonate. Ciprofloxacin In a randomized, two\u2013way crossover study in healthy volunteers examining the interaction potential of a single oral dose of ciprofloxacin (750 mg) alone and with lanthanum carbonate (1 g TID), the maximum plasma concentration of ciprofloxacin was reduced by 56% and the area under the ciprofloxacin plasma concentration-time curve was reduced by 54%. The 24-h urinary recovery of ciprofloxacin was reduced 52% by FOSRENOL [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Levothyroxine In a single-dose crossover study of levothyroxine (1 mg) with or without simultaneous administration of a single dose of FOSRENOL (500 mg) in six euthyroid normal healthy volunteers, the area under the serum T4 concentration-time curve was decreased by 40% [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ] . Fat Soluble Vitamins FOSRENOL appears not to affect the availability of fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K) or other nutrients [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Citrate Citrate did not increase the absorption of lanthanum."

        "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Oral administration of lanthanum carbonate to rats for up to 104 weeks, at doses up to 1500 mg of the salt per kg/day [2.5 times the MRHD of 5725 mg, on a mg/m 2 basis, assuming a 60-kg patient] revealed no evidence of carcinogenic potential. In the mouse, oral administration of lanthanum carbonate for up to 99 weeks, at a dose of 1500 mg/kg/day (1.3 times the MRHD) was associated with an increased incidence of glandular stomach adenomas in male mice. Lanthanum carbonate tested negative for mutagenic activity in an in vitro Ames assay using Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli strains and in vitro HGPRT gene mutation and chromosomal aberration assays in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Lanthanum carbonate also tested negative in an oral mouse micronucleus assay at doses up to 2000 mg/kg (1.7 times the MRHD), and in micronucleus and unscheduled DNA synthesis assays in rats given IV lanthanum chloride at doses up to 0.1 mg/kg, a dose that produced plasma lanthanum concentrations >2000 times the peak human plasma concentration.

Given the topical activity of lanthanum in the gut, and the excretion in feces of the majority of the dose, supportive therapy is recommended for overdosage. Lanthanum carbonate was not acutely toxic in animals by the oral route. No deaths and no adverse effects occurred in mice, rats or dogs after single oral doses of 2000 mg/kg (1.7, 3.4, and 11.3 times the MRHD, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis)."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CNS depressants: Enhanced CNS-depressant effects with combination use. Use with alcohol causes additive psychomotor impairment. ( 7.1 ) Imipramine: Decreased alertness observed with combination use. ( 7.1 ) Chlorpromazine: Impaired alertness and psychomotor performance observed with combination use. ( 7.1 ) Rifampin: Combination use decreases exposure to and effects of zolpidem. ( 7.2 ) Ketoconazole: Combination use increases exposure to and effect of zolpidem. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 CNS-active drugs Since the systematic evaluations of zolpidem in combination with other CNS-active drugs have been limited, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of any CNS-active drug to be used with zolpidem. Any drug with CNS-depressant effects could potentially enhance the CNS-depressant effects of zolpidem. Ambien was evaluated in healthy subjects in single-dose interaction studies for several CNS drugs. Imipramine in combination with zolpidem produced no pharmacokinetic interaction other than a 20% decrease in peak levels of imipramine, but there was an additive effect of decreased alertness. Similarly, chlorpromazine in combination with zolpidem produced no pharmacokinetic interaction, but there was an additive effect of decreased alertness and psychomotor performance. A study involving haloperidol and zolpidem revealed no effect of haloperidol on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of zolpidem. The lack of a drug interaction following single-dose administration does not predict a lack following chronic administration. An additive effect on psychomotor performance between alcohol and zolpidem was demonstrated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . A single-dose interaction study with zolpidem 10 mg and fluoxetine 20 mg at steady-state levels in male volunteers did not demonstrate any clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions. When multiple doses of zolpidem and fluoxetine at steady-state concentrations were evaluated in healthy females, the only significant change was a 17% increase in the zolpidem half-life. There was no evidence of an additive effect in psychomotor performance. Following five consecutive nightly doses of zolpidem 10 mg in the presence of sertraline 50 mg (17 consecutive daily doses, at 7:00 am, in healthy female volunteers), zolpidem C max was significantly higher (43%) and T max was significantly decreased (53%). Pharmacokinetics of sertraline and N-desmethylsertraline were unaffected by zolpidem. 7.2 Drugs that affect drug metabolism via cytochrome P450 Some compounds known to inhibit CYP3A may increase exposure to zolpidem. The effect of inhibitors of other P450 enzymes has not been carefully evaluated. A randomized, double-blind, crossover interaction study in ten healthy volunteers between itraconazole (200 mg once daily for 4 days) and a single dose of zolpidem (10 mg) given 5 hours after the last dose of itraconazole resulted in a 34% increase in AUC 0\u2013\u221e of zolpidem. There were no significant pharmacodynamic effects of zolpidem on subjective drowsiness, postural sway, or psychomotor performance. A randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover interaction study in eight healthy female subjects between five consecutive daily doses of rifampin (600 mg) and a single dose of zolpidem (20 mg) given 17 hours after the last dose of rifampin showed significant reductions of the AUC (\u201373%), C max (\u201358%), and T 1/2 (\u201336%) of zolpidem together with significant reductions in the pharmacodynamic effects of zolpidem. A randomized double-blind crossover interaction study in twelve healthy subjects showed that co-administration of a single 5 mg dose of zolpidem tartrate with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, given as 200 mg twice daily for 2 days increased C max of zolpidem by a factor of 1.3 and increased the total AUC of zolpidem by a factor of 1.7 compared to zolpidem alone and prolonged the elimination half-life by approximately 30% along with an increase in the pharmacodynamic effects of zolpidem. Caution should be used when ketoconazole is given with zolpidem and consideration should be given to using a lower dose of zolpidem when ketoconazole and zolpidem are given together. Patients should be advised that use of Ambien with ketoconazole may enhance the sedative effects. 7.3 Other drugs with no interaction with zolpidem A study involving cimetidine/zolpidem and ranitidine/zolpidem combinations revealed no effect of either drug on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of zolpidem. Zolpidem had no effect on digoxin pharmacokinetics and did not affect prothrombin time when given with warfarin in normal subjects. 7.4 Drug-laboratory test interactions Zolpidem is not known to interfere with commonly employed clinical laboratory tests. In addition, clinical data indicate that zolpidem does not cross-react with benzodiazepines, opiates, barbiturates, cocaine, cannabinoids, or amphetamines in two standard urine drug screens."

      "abuse": [
        "9.2 Abuse Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Abuse is characterized by misuse of the drug for non-medical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. Tolerance is a state of adaptation in which exposure to a drug induces changes that result in a diminution of one or more of the drug effects over time. Tolerance may occur to both desired and undesired effects of drugs and may develop at different rates for different effects. Addiction is a primary, chronic, neurobiological disease with genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors influencing its development and manifestations. It is characterized by behaviors that include one or more of the following: impaired control over drug use, compulsive use, continued use despite harm, and craving. Drug addiction is a treatable disease, using a multidisciplinary approach, but relapse is common. Studies of abuse potential in former drug abusers found that the effects of single doses of zolpidem tartrate 40 mg were similar, but not identical, to diazepam 20 mg, while zolpidem tartrate 10 mg was difficult to distinguish from placebo. Because persons with a history of addiction to, or abuse of, drugs or alcohol are at increased risk for misuse, abuse and addiction of zolpidem, they should be monitored carefully when receiving zolpidem or any other hypnotic."

In mice, these doses are approximately 2.5, 10, and 50 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day (8 mg zolpidem base) on mg/m 2 basis. In rats, these doses are approximately 5, 20, and 100 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. No evidence of carcinogenic potential was observed in mice. In rats, renal tumors (lipoma, liposarcoma) were seen at the mid- and high doses. Mutagenesis : Zolpidem was negative in in vitro (bacterial reverse mutation, mouse lymphoma, and chromosomal aberration) and in vivo (mouse micronucleus) genetic toxicology assays. Impairment of fertility : Oral administration of zolpidem (doses of 4, 20, and 100 mg base/kg or approximately 5, 24, and 120 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) to rats prior to and during mating, and continuing in females through postpartum day 25, resulted in irregular estrus cycles and prolonged precoital intervals.

      "mechanism_of_action": [
        "12.1 Mechanism of action Zolpidem, the active moiety of zolpidem tartrate, is a hypnotic agent with a chemical structure unrelated to benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or other drugs with known hypnotic properties. It interacts with a GABA-BZ receptor complex and shares some of the pharmacological properties of the benzodiazepines. In contrast to the benzodiazepines, which non-selectively bind to and activate all BZ receptor subtypes, zolpidem in vitro binds the BZ 1 receptor preferentially with a high affinity ratio of the \u03b1 1 /\u03b1 5 subunits. This selective binding of zolpidem on the BZ 1 receptor is not absolute, but it may explain the relative absence of myorelaxant and anticonvulsant effects in animal studies as well as the preservation of deep sleep (stages 3 and 4) in human studies of zolpidem tartrate at hypnotic doses."

      "pharmacokinetics": [
        "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic profile of Ambien is characterized by rapid absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and a short elimination half-life (T 1/2 ) in healthy subjects. In a single-dose crossover study in 45 healthy subjects administered 5 and 10 mg zolpidem tartrate tablets, the mean peak concentrations (C max ) were 59 (range: 29 to 113) and 121 (range: 58 to 272) ng/mL, respectively, occurring at a mean time (T max ) of 1.6 hours for both. The mean Ambien elimination half-life was 2.6 (range: 1.4 to 4.5) and 2.5 (range: 1.4 to 3.8) hours, for the 5 and 10 mg tablets, respectively. Ambien is converted to inactive metabolites that are eliminated primarily by renal excretion. Ambien demonstrated linear kinetics in the dose range of 5 to 20 mg. Total protein binding was found to be 92.5 \u00b1 0.1% and remained constant, independent of concentration between 40 and 790 ng/mL. Zolpidem did not accumulate in young adults following nightly dosing with 20 mg zolpidem tartrate tablets for 2 weeks. A food-effect study in 30 healthy male subjects compared the pharmacokinetics of Ambien 10 mg when administered while fasting or 20 minutes after a meal. Results demonstrated that with food, mean AUC and C max were decreased by 15% and 25%, respectively, while mean T max was prolonged by 60% (from 1.4 to 2.2 hr). The half-life remained unchanged. These results suggest that, for faster sleep onset, Ambien should not be administered with or immediately after a meal. Special Populations Elderly: In the elderly, the dose for Ambien should be 5 mg [see Warnings and Precautions (5) and Dosage and Administration (2) ] . This recommendation is based on several studies in which the mean C max , T 1/2 , and AUC were significantly increased when compared to results in young adults. In one study of eight elderly subjects (> 70 years), the means for C max , T 1/2 , and AUC significantly increased by 50% (255 vs. 384 ng/mL), 32% (2.2 vs. 2.9 hr), and 64% (955 vs. 1,562 ng\u2219hr/mL), respectively, as compared to younger adults (20 to 40 years) following a single 20 mg oral dose. Ambien did not accumulate in elderly subjects following nightly oral dosing of 10 mg for 1 week. Hepatic Impairment: The pharmacokinetics of Ambien in eight patients with chronic hepatic insufficiency were compared to results in healthy subjects. Following a single 20 mg oral zolpidem tartrate dose, mean C max and AUC were found to be two times (250 vs. 499 ng/mL) and five times (788 vs. 4,203 ng\u2219hr/mL) higher, respectively, in hepatically -compromised patients. T max did not change. The mean half-life in cirrhotic patients of 9.9 hr (range: 4.1 to 25.8 hr) was greater than that observed in normal subjects of 2.2 hr (range: 1.6 to 2.4 hr). Dosing should be modified accordingly in patients with hepatic insufficiency [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Renal Impairment: The pharmacokinetics of zolpidem tartrate were studied in 11 patients with end-stage renal failure (mean Cl Cr = 6.5 \u00b1 1.5 mL/min) undergoing hemodialysis three times a week, who were dosed with zolpidem tartrate 10 mg orally each day for 14 or 21 days. No statistically significant differences were observed for C max , T max , half-life, and AUC between the first and last day of drug administration when baseline concentration adjustments were made. On day 1, C max was 172 \u00b1 29 ng/mL (range: 46 to 344 ng/mL). After repeated dosing for 14 or 21 days, C max was 203 \u00b1 32 ng/mL (range: 28 to 316 ng/mL). On day 1, T max was 1.7 \u00b1 0.3 hr (range: 0.5 to 3.0 hr); after repeated dosing T max was 0.8 \u00b1 0.2 hr (range: 0.5 to 2.0 hr). This variation is accounted for by noting that last-day serum sampling began 10 hours after the previous dose, rather than after 24 hours. This resulted in residual drug concentration and a shorter period to reach maximal serum concentration. On day 1, T 1/2 was 2.4 \u00b1 0.4 hr (range: 0.4 to 5.1 hr). After repeated dosing, T 1/2 was 2.5 \u00b1 0.4 hr (range: 0.7 to 4.2 hr). AUC was 796 \u00b1 159 ng\u2219hr/mL after the first dose and 818 \u00b1 170 ng\u2219hr/mL after repeated dosing. Zolpidem was not hemodialyzable. No accumulation of unchanged drug appeared after 14 or 21 days. Zolpidem pharmacokinetics were not significantly different in renally impaired patients. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with compromised renal function. However, as a general precaution, these patients should be closely monitored."

Sedative/hypnotics have produced withdrawal signs and symptoms following abrupt discontinuation. These reported symptoms range from mild dysphoria and insomnia to a withdrawal syndrome that may include abdominal and muscle cramps, vomiting, sweating, tremors, and convulsions. The following adverse events which are considered to meet the DSM-III-R criteria for uncomplicated sedative/hypnotic withdrawal were reported during U.S. clinical trials following placebo substitution occurring within 48 hours following last zolpidem treatment: fatigue, nausea, flushing, lightheadedness, uncontrolled crying, emesis, stomach cramps, panic attack, nervousness, and abdominal discomfort. These reported adverse events occurred at an incidence of 1% or less. However, available data cannot provide a reliable estimate of the incidence, if any, of dependence during treatment at recommended doses.

Ambien should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Administration of zolpidem to pregnant rats and rabbits resulted in adverse effects on offspring development at doses greater than the Ambien maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day (approximately 8 mg/day zolpidem base); however, teratogenicity was not observed. When zolpidem was administered at oral doses of 4, 20, and 100 mg base/kg (approximately 5, 24 and 120 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis, dose-related decreases in fetal skull ossification occurred at all but the lowest dose, which is approximately 5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. In rabbits treated during organogenesis with zolpidem at oral doses of 1, 4, and 16 mg base/kg (approximately 2.5, 10 and 40 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis), increased embryo-fetal death and incomplete fetal skeletal ossification occurred at the highest dose. The no-effect dose for embryo-fetal toxicity in rabbits is approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. Administration of zolpidem to rats at oral doses of 4, 20, and 100 mg base/kg (approximately 5, 24 and 120 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) during the latter part of pregnancy and throughout lactation produced decreased offspring growth and survival at all but the lowest dose, which is approximately 5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. Neonatal Complications Studies in children to assess the effects of prenatal exposure to zolpidem have not been conducted; however, cases of severe neonatal respiratory depression have been reported when zolpidem was used at the end of pregnancy, especially when taken with other CNS depressants. Children born to mothers taking sedative-hypnotic drugs may be at some risk for withdrawal symptoms during the postnatal period.

      "drug_abuse_and_dependence": [
        "9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled substance Zolpidem tartrate is classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance by federal regulation. 9.2 Abuse Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Abuse is characterized by misuse of the drug for non-medical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. Tolerance is a state of adaptation in which exposure to a drug induces changes that result in a diminution of one or more of the drug effects over time. Tolerance may occur to both desired and undesired effects of drugs and may develop at different rates for different effects. Addiction is a primary, chronic, neurobiological disease with genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors influencing its development and manifestations. It is characterized by behaviors that include one or more of the following: impaired control over drug use, compulsive use, continued use despite harm, and craving. Drug addiction is a treatable disease, using a multidisciplinary approach, but relapse is common. Studies of abuse potential in former drug abusers found that the effects of single doses of zolpidem tartrate 40 mg were similar, but not identical, to diazepam 20 mg, while zolpidem tartrate 10 mg was difficult to distinguish from placebo. Because persons with a history of addiction to, or abuse of, drugs or alcohol are at increased risk for misuse, abuse and addiction of zolpidem, they should be monitored carefully when receiving zolpidem or any other hypnotic. 9.3 Dependence Physical dependence is a state of adaptation that is manifested by a specific withdrawal syndrome that can be produced by abrupt cessation, rapid dose reduction, decreasing blood level of the drug, and/or administration of an antagonist. Sedative/hypnotics have produced withdrawal signs and symptoms following abrupt discontinuation.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Need to evaluate for co-morbid diagnosis: Reevaluate if insomnia persists after 7 to 10 days of use ( 5.1 ) Severe anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions: Angioedema and anaphylaxis have been reported. Do not rechallenge if such reactions occur. ( 5.2 ) Abnormal thinking, behavioral changes and complex behaviors: May include \"sleep-driving\" and hallucinations. Immediately evaluate any new onset behavioral changes. ( 5.3 ) Depression: Worsening of depression or, suicidal thinking may occur. Prescribe the least amount feasible to avoid intentional overdose ( 5.3 , 5.6 ) Withdrawal effects: Symptoms may occur with rapid dose reduction or discontinuation. ( 5.4 , 9.3 ) CNS depressant effects: Use can impair alertness and motor coordination. If used in combination with other CNS depressants, dose reductions may be needed due to additive effects. Do not use with alcohol ( 2.3 , 5.5 ) Elderly/debilitated patients: Use lower dose due to impaired motor, cognitive performance and increased sensitivity ( 2.2 , 5.6 ) Patients with hepatic impairment, mild to moderate COPD, impaired drug metabolism or hemodynamic responses, mild to moderate sleep apnea: Use with caution and monitor closely. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Need to evaluate for co-morbid diagnoses Because sleep disturbances may be the presenting manifestation of a physical and/or psychiatric disorder, symptomatic treatment of insomnia should be initiated only after a careful evaluation of the patient. The failure of insomnia to remit after 7 to 10 days of treatment may indicate the presence of a primary psychiatric and/or medical illness that should be evaluated. Worsening of insomnia or the emergence of new thinking or behavior abnormalities may be the consequence of an unrecognized psychiatric or physical disorder. Such findings have emerged during the course of treatment with sedative/hypnotic drugs, including zolpidem. 5.2 Severe anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions Rare cases of angioedema involving the tongue, glottis or larynx have been reported in patients after taking the first or subsequent doses of sedative-hypnotics, including zolpidem. Some patients have had additional symptoms such as dyspnea, throat closing or nausea and vomiting that suggest anaphylaxis. Some patients have required medical therapy in the emergency department. If angioedema involves the throat, glottis or larynx, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. Patients who develop angioedema after treatment with zolpidem should not be rechallenged with the drug. 5.3 Abnormal thinking and behavioral changes A variety of abnormal thinking and behavior changes have been reported to occur in association with the use of sedative/hypnotics. Some of these changes may be characterized by decreased inhibition (e.g., aggressiveness and extroversion that seemed out of character), similar to effects produced by alcohol and other CNS depressants. Visual and auditory hallucinations have been reported as well as behavioral changes such as bizarre behavior, agitation and depersonalization. In controlled trials, < 1% of adults with insomnia who received zolpidem reported hallucinations. In a clinical trial, 7.4% of pediatric patients with insomnia associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), who received zolpidem reported hallucinations [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . Complex behaviors such as \"sleep-driving\" (i.e., driving while not fully awake after ingestion of a sedative-hypnotic, with amnesia for the event) have been reported with sedative-hypnotics, including zolpidem. These events can occur in sedative-hypnotic-naive as well as in sedative-hypnotic-experienced persons. Although behaviors such as \"sleep-driving\" may occur with Ambien alone at therapeutic doses, the use of alcohol and other CNS depressants with Ambien appears to increase the risk of such behaviors, as does the use of Ambien at doses exceeding the maximum recommended dose. Due to the risk to the patient and the community, discontinuation of Ambien should be strongly considered for patients who report a \"sleep-driving\" episode. Other complex behaviors (e.g., preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex) have been reported in patients who are not fully awake after taking a sedative-hypnotic. As with \"sleep-driving\", patients usually do not remember these events. Amnesia, anxiety and other neuro-psychiatric symptoms may occur unpredictably. In primarily depressed patients, worsening of depression, including suicidal thoughts and actions (including completed suicides), has been reported in association with the use of sedative/hypnotics. It can rarely be determined with certainty whether a particular instance of the abnormal behaviors listed above is drug induced, spontaneous in origin, or a result of an underlying psychiatric or physical disorder. Nonetheless, the emergence of any new behavioral sign or symptom of concern requires careful and immediate evaluation. 5.4 Withdrawal effects Following the rapid dose decrease or abrupt discontinuation of sedative/hypnotics, there have been reports of signs and symptoms similar to those associated with withdrawal from other CNS-depressant drugs [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) ] . 5.5 CNS depressant effects Ambien, like other sedative/hypnotic drugs, has CNS-depressant effects. Due to the rapid onset of action, Ambien should only be taken immediately prior to going to bed. Patients should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness or motor coordination such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle after ingesting the drug, including potential impairment of the performance of such activities that may occur the day following ingestion of Ambien. Ambien showed additive effects when combined with alcohol and should not be taken with alcohol. Patients should also be cautioned about possible combined effects with other CNS-depressant drugs. Dosage adjustments may be necessary when Ambien is administered with such agents because of the potentially additive effects. 5.6 Special populations Use in the elderly and/or debilitated patients: Impaired motor and/or cognitive performance after repeated exposure or unusual sensitivity to sedative/hypnotic drugs is a concern in the treatment of elderly and/or debilitated patients. Therefore, the recommended Ambien dosage is 5 mg in such patients to decrease the possibility of side effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . These patients should be closely monitored. Use in patients with concomitant illness: Clinical experience with Ambien (zolpidem tartrate) in patients with concomitant systemic illness is limited. Caution is advisable in using Ambien in patients with diseases or conditions that could affect metabolism or hemodynamic responses. Although studies did not reveal respiratory depressant effects at hypnotic doses of zolpidem in normal subjects or in patients with mild to moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a reduction in the Total Arousal Index together with a reduction in lowest oxygen saturation and increase in the times of oxygen desaturation below 80% and 90% was observed in patients with mild-to-moderate sleep apnea when treated with Ambien (10 mg) when compared to placebo. Since sedative/hypnotics have the capacity to depress respiratory drive, precautions should be taken if Ambien is prescribed to patients with compromised respiratory function. Post-marketing reports of respiratory insufficiency, most of which involved patients with pre-existing respiratory impairment, have been received. Ambien should be used with caution in patients with sleep apnea syndrome or myasthenia gravis. Data in end-stage renal failure patients repeatedly treated with Ambien did not demonstrate drug accumulation or alterations in pharmacokinetic parameters. No dosage adjustment in renally impaired patients is required; however, these patients should be closely monitored [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . A study in subjects with hepatic impairment did reveal prolonged elimination in this group; therefore, treatment should be initiated with 5 mg in patients with hepatic compromise, and they should be closely monitored [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Use in patients with depression: As with other sedative/hypnotic drugs, Ambien should be administered with caution to patients exhibiting signs or symptoms of depression. Suicidal tendencies may be present in such patients and protective measures may be required. Intentional over-dosage is more common in this group of patients; therefore, the least amount of drug that is feasible should be prescribed for the patient at any one time. Use in pediatric patients: Safety and effectiveness of zolpidem have not been established in pediatric patients. In an 8-week study in pediatric patients (aged 6\u201317 years) with insomnia associated with ADHD, zolpidem did not decrease sleep latency compared to placebo. Hallucinations were reported in 7.4% of the pediatric patients who received zolpidem; none of the pediatric patients who received placebo reported hallucinations [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] ."

Reactions most commonly associated with discontinuation from U.S. trials were daytime drowsiness (0.5%), dizziness (0.4%), headache (0.5%), nausea (0.6%), and vomiting (0.5%). Approximately 4% of 1,959 patients who received zolpidem at all doses (1 to 50 mg) in similar foreign trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse reaction. Reactions most commonly associated with discontinuation from these trials were daytime drowsiness (1.1%), dizziness/vertigo (0.8%), amnesia (0.5%), nausea (0.5%), headache (0.4%), and falls (0.4%). Data from a clinical study in which selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-treated patients were given zolpidem revealed that four of the seven discontinuations during double-blind treatment with zolpidem (n=95) were associated with impaired concentration, continuing or aggravated depression, and manic reaction; one patient treated with placebo (n =97) was discontinued after an attempted suicide. Most commonly observed adverse reactions in controlled trials: During short-term treatment (up to 10 nights) with Ambien at doses up to 10 mg, the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of zolpidem and seen at statistically significant differences from placebo-treated patients were drowsiness (reported by 2% of zolpidem patients), dizziness (1%), and diarrhea (1%). During longer-term treatment (28 to 35 nights) with zolpidem at doses up to 10 mg, the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of zolpidem and seen at statistically significant differences from placebo-treated patients were dizziness (5%) and drugged feelings (3%). Adverse reactions observed at an incidence of \u2265 1% in controlled trials: The following tables enumerate treatment-emergent adverse reactions frequencies that were observed at an incidence equal to 1% or greater among patients with insomnia who received zolpidem tartrate and at a greater incidence than placebo in U.S. placebo-controlled trials. Events reported by investigators were classified utilizing a modified World Health Organization (WHO) dictionary of preferred terms for the purpose of establishing event frequencies. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice, in which patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in these clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigators involving related drug products and uses, since each group of drug trials is conducted under a different set of conditions. However, the cited figures provide the physician with a basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the incidence of side effects in the population studied. The following table was derived from results of 11 placebo-controlled short-term U.S. efficacy trials involving zolpidem in doses ranging from 1.25 to 20 mg. The table is limited to data from doses up to and including 10 mg, the highest dose recommended for use. Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Experiences in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials Lasting up to 10 Nights (Percentage of patients reporting) Body System/ Adverse Event Reactions reported by at least 1% of patients treated with Ambien and at a greater frequency than placebo.

These trials involved patients with chronic insomnia who were treated for 28 to 35 nights with zolpidem at doses of 5, 10, or 15 mg. The table is limited to data from doses up to and including 10 mg, the highest dose recommended for use. The table includes only adverse events occurring at an incidence of at least 1% for zolpidem patients. Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Experiences in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials Lasting up to 35 Nights (Percentage of patients reporting) Body System/ Adverse Event Reactions reported by at least 1% of patients treated with Ambien and at a greater frequency than placebo.

Adverse event incidence across the entire preapproval database: Ambien was administered to 3,660 subjects in clinical trials throughout the U.S., Canada, and Europe. Treatment-emergent adverse events associated with clinical trial participation were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing treatment-emergent adverse events, similar types of untoward events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized event categories and classified utilizing a modified World Health Organization (WHO) dictionary of preferred terms. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportions of the 3,660 individuals exposed to zolpidem, at all doses, who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving zolpidem. All reported treatment-emergent adverse events are included, except those already listed in the table above of adverse events in placebo-controlled studies, those coding terms that are so general as to be uninformative, and those events where a drug cause was remote. It is important to emphasize that, although the events reported did occur during treatment with Ambien, they were not necessarily caused by it. Adverse events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in greater than 1/100 subjects; infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients; rare events are those occurring in less than 1/1,000 patients.

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, zolpidem may cause fetal harm. ( 8.1 ) Nursing mothers: Zolpidem is excreted in human milk. ( 8.3 ) Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness not established. Hallucinations (incidence rate 7.4%) and other psychiatric and/or nervous system adverse reactions were observed frequently in a study of pediatric patients with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder ( 5.6 , 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Ambien in pregnant women. Ambien should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Administration of zolpidem to pregnant rats and rabbits resulted in adverse effects on offspring development at doses greater than the Ambien maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day (approximately 8 mg/day zolpidem base); however, teratogenicity was not observed. When zolpidem was administered at oral doses of 4, 20, and 100 mg base/kg (approximately 5, 24 and 120 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis, dose-related decreases in fetal skull ossification occurred at all but the lowest dose, which is approximately 5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. In rabbits treated during organogenesis with zolpidem at oral doses of 1, 4, and 16 mg base/kg (approximately 2.5, 10 and 40 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis), increased embryo-fetal death and incomplete fetal skeletal ossification occurred at the highest dose. The no-effect dose for embryo-fetal toxicity in rabbits is approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. Administration of zolpidem to rats at oral doses of 4, 20, and 100 mg base/kg (approximately 5, 24 and 120 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) during the latter part of pregnancy and throughout lactation produced decreased offspring growth and survival at all but the lowest dose, which is approximately 5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. Neonatal Complications Studies in children to assess the effects of prenatal exposure to zolpidem have not been conducted; however, cases of severe neonatal respiratory depression have been reported when zolpidem was used at the end of pregnancy, especially when taken with other CNS depressants. Children born to mothers taking sedative-hypnotic drugs may be at some risk for withdrawal symptoms during the postnatal period. Neonatal flaccidity has also been reported in infants born to mothers who received sedative-hypnotic drugs during pregnancy. 8.2 Labor and delivery Ambien has no established use in labor and delivery [see Pregnancy (8.1) ] . 8.3 Nursing mothers Zolpidem is excreted in human milk. Studies in lactating mothers indicate that the half-life of zolpidem is similar to that in non-lactating women (2.6 \u00b1 0.3 hr). The effect of zolpidem on the nursing infant is not known. Caution should be exercised when Ambien is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric use Safety and effectiveness of zolpidem have not been established in pediatric patients. In an 8-week controlled study, 201 pediatric patients (aged 6\u201317 years) with insomnia associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (90% of the patients were using psychoanaleptics) were treated with an oral solution of zolpidem (n=136), or placebo (n=65). Zolpidem did not significantly decrease latency to persistent sleep, compared to placebo, as measured by polysomnography after 4 weeks of treatment. Psychiatric and nervous system disorders comprised the most frequent (> 5%) treatment emergent adverse reactions observed with zolpidem versus placebo and included dizziness (23.5% vs. 1.5%), headache (12.5% vs. 9.2%), and hallucinations (7.4% vs. 0%) [see Warnings and Precautions(5.6)] . Ten patients on zolpidem (7.4%) discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction. 8.5 Geriatric use A total of 154 patients in U.S. controlled clinical trials and 897 patients in non-U.S. clinical trials who received zolpidem were \u2265 60 years of age. For a pool of U.S. patients receiving zolpidem at doses of \u226410 mg or placebo, there were three adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of at least 3% for zolpidem and for which the zolpidem incidence was at least twice the placebo incidence (i.e., they could be considered drug related). Adverse Event Zolpidem Placebo Dizziness Drowsiness Diarrhea 3% 5% 3% 0% 2% 1% A total of 30/1,959 (1.5%) non-U.S. patients receiving zolpidem reported falls, including 28/30 (93%) who were \u2265 70 years of age. Of these 28 patients, 23 (82%) were receiving zolpidem doses >10 mg. A total of 24/1,959 (1.2%) non-U.S. patients receiving zolpidem reported confusion, including 18/24 (75%) who were \u2265 70 years of age. Of these 18 patients, 14 (78%) were receiving zolpidem doses >10 mg. The dose of Ambien in elderly patients is 5 mg to minimize adverse effects related to impaired motor and/or cognitive performance and unusual sensitivity to sedative/hypnotic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] ."

Describe the signs/symptoms of these reactions and advise patients to seek medical attention immediately if any of them occur. 17.2 Sleep-driving and other complex behaviors There have been reports of people getting out of bed after taking a sedative-hypnotic and driving their cars while not fully awake, often with no memory of the event. If a patient experiences such an episode, it should be reported to his or her doctor immediately, since \"sleep-driving\" can be dangerous. This behavior is more likely to occur when Ambien is taken with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Other complex behaviors (e.g., preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex) have been reported in patients who are not fully awake after taking a sedative-hypnotic. As with \"sleep-driving\", patients usually do not remember these events. In addition, patients should be advised to report all concomitant medications to the prescriber. Patients should be instructed to report events such as \"sleep-driving\" and other complex behaviors immediately to the prescriber. 17.3 Administration instructions Patients should be counseled to take Ambien right before they get into bed and only when they are able to stay in bed a full night (7\u20138 hours) before being active again. Ambien tablets should not be taken with or immediately after a meal. Advise patients NOT to take Ambien when drinking alcohol. 17.4 Medication Guide"

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Transient insomnia Normal adults experiencing transient insomnia (n = 462) during the first night in a sleep laboratory were evaluated in a double-blind, parallel group, single-night trial comparing two doses of zolpidem (7.5 and 10 mg) and placebo. Both zolpidem doses were superior to placebo on objective (polysomnographic) measures of sleep latency, sleep duration, and number of awakenings. Normal elderly adults (mean age 68) experiencing transient insomnia (n = 35) during the first two nights in a sleep laboratory were evaluated in a double-blind, crossover, 2-night trial comparing four doses of zolpidem (5, 10, 15 and 20 mg) and placebo. All zolpidem doses were superior to placebo on the two primary PSG parameters (sleep latency and efficiency) and all four subjective outcome measures (sleep duration, sleep latency, number of awakenings, and sleep quality). 14.2 Chronic insomnia Zolpidem was evaluated in two controlled studies for the treatment of patients with chronic insomnia (most closely resembling primary insomnia, as defined in the APA Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, DSM-IV\u2122). Adult outpatients with chronic insomnia (n = 75) were evaluated in a double-blind, parallel group, 5-week trial comparing two doses of zolpidem tartrate and placebo. On objective (polysomnographic) measures of sleep latency and sleep efficiency, zolpidem 10 mg was superior to placebo on sleep latency for the first 4 weeks and on sleep efficiency for weeks 2 and 4. Zolpidem was comparable to placebo on number of awakenings at both doses studied. Adult outpatients (n=141) with chronic insomnia were also evaluated, in a double-blind, parallel group, 4-week trial comparing two doses of zolpidem and placebo. Zolpidem 10 mg was superior to placebo on a subjective measure of sleep latency for all 4 weeks, and on subjective measures of total sleep time, number of awakenings, and sleep quality for the first treatment week. Increased wakefulness during the last third of the night as measured by polysomnography has not been observed in clinical trials with Ambien. 14.3 Studies pertinent to safety concerns for sedative/hypnotic drugs Next-day residual effects: Next-day residual effects of Ambien were evaluated in seven studies involving normal subjects. In three studies in adults (including one study in a phase advance model of transient insomnia) and in one study in elderly subjects, a small but statistically significant decrease in performance was observed in the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) when compared to placebo. Studies of Ambien in non-elderly patients with insomnia did not detect evidence of next-day residual effects using the DSST, the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), and patient ratings of alertness. Rebound effects: There was no objective (polysomnographic) evidence of rebound insomnia at recommended doses seen in studies evaluating sleep on the nights following discontinuation of Ambien (zolpidem tartrate). There was subjective evidence of impaired sleep in the elderly on the first post-treatment night at doses above the recommended elderly dose of 5 mg. Memory impairment: Controlled studies in adults utilizing objective measures of memory yielded no consistent evidence of next-day memory impairment following the administration of Ambien. However, in one study involving zolpidem doses of 10 and 20 mg, there was a significant decrease in next-morning recall of information presented to subjects during peak drug effect (90 minutes post-dose), i.e., these subjects experienced anterograde amnesia. There was also subjective evidence from adverse event data for anterograde amnesia occurring in association with the administration of Ambien, predominantly at doses above 10 mg. Effects on sleep stages: In studies that measured the percentage of sleep time spent in each sleep stage, Ambien has generally been shown to preserve sleep stages. Sleep time spent in stages 3 and 4 (deep sleep) was found comparable to placebo with only inconsistent, minor changes in REM (paradoxical) sleep at the recommended dose."

There may be new information. This Medication Guide does not take the place of talking to your doctor about your medical condition or treatment. What is the most important information I should know about AMBIEN? After taking AMBIEN, you may get up out of bed while not being fully awake and do an activity that you do not know you are doing. The next morning, you may not remember that you did anything during the night. You have a higher chance for doing these activities if you drink alcohol or take other medicines that make you sleepy with AMBIEN. Reported activities include: driving a car (\"sleep-driving\") making and eating food talking on the phone having sex sleep-walking Call your doctor right away if you find out that you have done any of the above activities after taking AMBIEN.

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of action Zolpidem, the active moiety of zolpidem tartrate, is a hypnotic agent with a chemical structure unrelated to benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or other drugs with known hypnotic properties. It interacts with a GABA-BZ receptor complex and shares some of the pharmacological properties of the benzodiazepines. In contrast to the benzodiazepines, which non-selectively bind to and activate all BZ receptor subtypes, zolpidem in vitro binds the BZ 1 receptor preferentially with a high affinity ratio of the \u03b1 1 /\u03b1 5 subunits. This selective binding of zolpidem on the BZ 1 receptor is not absolute, but it may explain the relative absence of myorelaxant and anticonvulsant effects in animal studies as well as the preservation of deep sleep (stages 3 and 4) in human studies of zolpidem tartrate at hypnotic doses. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic profile of Ambien is characterized by rapid absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and a short elimination half-life (T 1/2 ) in healthy subjects. In a single-dose crossover study in 45 healthy subjects administered 5 and 10 mg zolpidem tartrate tablets, the mean peak concentrations (C max ) were 59 (range: 29 to 113) and 121 (range: 58 to 272) ng/mL, respectively, occurring at a mean time (T max ) of 1.6 hours for both. The mean Ambien elimination half-life was 2.6 (range: 1.4 to 4.5) and 2.5 (range: 1.4 to 3.8) hours, for the 5 and 10 mg tablets, respectively. Ambien is converted to inactive metabolites that are eliminated primarily by renal excretion. Ambien demonstrated linear kinetics in the dose range of 5 to 20 mg. Total protein binding was found to be 92.5 \u00b1 0.1% and remained constant, independent of concentration between 40 and 790 ng/mL. Zolpidem did not accumulate in young adults following nightly dosing with 20 mg zolpidem tartrate tablets for 2 weeks. A food-effect study in 30 healthy male subjects compared the pharmacokinetics of Ambien 10 mg when administered while fasting or 20 minutes after a meal. Results demonstrated that with food, mean AUC and C max were decreased by 15% and 25%, respectively, while mean T max was prolonged by 60% (from 1.4 to 2.2 hr). The half-life remained unchanged. These results suggest that, for faster sleep onset, Ambien should not be administered with or immediately after a meal. Special Populations Elderly: In the elderly, the dose for Ambien should be 5 mg [see Warnings and Precautions (5) and Dosage and Administration (2) ] . This recommendation is based on several studies in which the mean C max , T 1/2 , and AUC were significantly increased when compared to results in young adults. In one study of eight elderly subjects (> 70 years), the means for C max , T 1/2 , and AUC significantly increased by 50% (255 vs. 384 ng/mL), 32% (2.2 vs. 2.9 hr), and 64% (955 vs. 1,562 ng\u2219hr/mL), respectively, as compared to younger adults (20 to 40 years) following a single 20 mg oral dose. Ambien did not accumulate in elderly subjects following nightly oral dosing of 10 mg for 1 week. Hepatic Impairment: The pharmacokinetics of Ambien in eight patients with chronic hepatic insufficiency were compared to results in healthy subjects. Following a single 20 mg oral zolpidem tartrate dose, mean C max and AUC were found to be two times (250 vs. 499 ng/mL) and five times (788 vs. 4,203 ng\u2219hr/mL) higher, respectively, in hepatically -compromised patients. T max did not change. The mean half-life in cirrhotic patients of 9.9 hr (range: 4.1 to 25.8 hr) was greater than that observed in normal subjects of 2.2 hr (range: 1.6 to 2.4 hr). Dosing should be modified accordingly in patients with hepatic insufficiency [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Renal Impairment: The pharmacokinetics of zolpidem tartrate were studied in 11 patients with end-stage renal failure (mean Cl Cr = 6.5 \u00b1 1.5 mL/min) undergoing hemodialysis three times a week, who were dosed with zolpidem tartrate 10 mg orally each day for 14 or 21 days. No statistically significant differences were observed for C max , T max , half-life, and AUC between the first and last day of drug administration when baseline concentration adjustments were made. On day 1, C max was 172 \u00b1 29 ng/mL (range: 46 to 344 ng/mL). After repeated dosing for 14 or 21 days, C max was 203 \u00b1 32 ng/mL (range: 28 to 316 ng/mL). On day 1, T max was 1.7 \u00b1 0.3 hr (range: 0.5 to 3.0 hr); after repeated dosing T max was 0.8 \u00b1 0.2 hr (range: 0.5 to 2.0 hr). This variation is accounted for by noting that last-day serum sampling began 10 hours after the previous dose, rather than after 24 hours. This resulted in residual drug concentration and a shorter period to reach maximal serum concentration. On day 1, T 1/2 was 2.4 \u00b1 0.4 hr (range: 0.4 to 5.1 hr). After repeated dosing, T 1/2 was 2.5 \u00b1 0.4 hr (range: 0.7 to 4.2 hr). AUC was 796 \u00b1 159 ng\u2219hr/mL after the first dose and 818 \u00b1 170 ng\u2219hr/mL after repeated dosing. Zolpidem was not hemodialyzable. No accumulation of unchanged drug appeared after 14 or 21 days. Zolpidem pharmacokinetics were not significantly different in renally impaired patients. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with compromised renal function. However, as a general precaution, these patients should be closely monitored."

      "carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility": [
        "13.1 Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility Carcinogenesis : Zolpidem was administered to mice and rats for 2 years at dietary dosages of 4, 18, and 80 mg base/kg. In mice, these doses are approximately 2.5, 10, and 50 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day (8 mg zolpidem base) on mg/m 2 basis. In rats, these doses are approximately 5, 20, and 100 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. No evidence of carcinogenic potential was observed in mice. In rats, renal tumors (lipoma, liposarcoma) were seen at the mid- and high doses. Mutagenesis : Zolpidem was negative in in vitro (bacterial reverse mutation, mouse lymphoma, and chromosomal aberration) and in vivo (mouse micronucleus) genetic toxicology assays. Impairment of fertility : Oral administration of zolpidem (doses of 4, 20, and 100 mg base/kg or approximately 5, 24, and 120 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) to rats prior to and during mating, and continuing in females through postpartum day 25, resulted in irregular estrus cycles and prolonged precoital intervals. The no-effect dose for these findings is approximately 24 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. There was no impairment of fertility at any dose tested."

      "overdosage": [
        "10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and symptoms In postmarketing experience of overdose with zolpidem tartrate alone, or in combination with CNS-depressant agents, impairment of consciousness ranging from somnolence to coma, cardiovascular and/or respiratory compromise, and fatal outcomes have been reported. 10.2 Recommended treatment General symptomatic and supportive measures should be used along with immediate gastric lavage where appropriate. Intravenous fluids should be administered as needed. Zolpidem's sedative hypnotic effect was shown to be reduced by flumazenil and therefore may be useful; however, flumazenil administration may contribute to the appearance of neurological symptoms (convulsions). As in all cases of drug overdose, respiration, pulse, blood pressure, and other appropriate signs should be monitored and general supportive measures employed. Hypotension and CNS depression should be monitored and treated by appropriate medical intervention. Sedating drugs should be withheld following zolpidem overdosage, even if excitation occurs. The value of dialysis in the treatment of overdosage has not been determined, although hemodialysis studies in patients with renal failure receiving therapeutic doses have demonstrated that zolpidem is not dialyzable. As with the management of all overdosage, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered. The physician may wish to consider contacting a poison control center for up-to-date information on the management of hypnotic drug product overdosage."

      ],
      "dosage_and_administration": [
        "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Anorexia Associated with Weight Loss in Adult Patients with AIDS (2.1): The recommended adult starting dosage is 2.5 mg orally twice daily, one hour before lunch and dinner. See the full prescribing information for dosage titration to manage adverse reactions and to achieve desired therapeutic effect. Nausea and Vomiting Associated with Chemotherapy in Adult Patients Who Failed Conventional Antiemetics (2.2): The recommended starting dosage is 5 mg/m 2 , administered 1 to 3 hours prior to the administration of chemotherapy, then every 2 to 4 hours after chemotherapy, for a total of 4 to 6 doses per day. Administer the first dose on an empty stomach at least 30 minutes prior to eating; subsequent doses can be taken without regard to meals. See the full prescribing information for dosage titration to manage adverse reactions and to achieve desired therapeutic effect. 2.1 Anorexia Associated with Weight Loss in Adult Patients with AIDS Starting Dosage The recommended adult starting dosage of dronabinol capsules is 2.5 mg orally twice daily, one hour before lunch and dinner. In elderly patients or patients unable to tolerate 2.5 mg twice daily, consider initiating dronabinol capsules at 2.5 mg once daily one hour before dinner or at bedtime to reduce the risk of central nervous system (CNS) symptoms [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Dosing later in the day may reduce the frequency of CNS adverse reactions. CNS adverse reactions are dose-related [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]; therefore monitor patients and reduce the dosage as needed. If CNS adverse reactions of feeling high, dizziness, confusion, and somnolence occur, they usually resolve in 1 to 3 days and usually do not require dosage reduction. If CNS adverse reactions are severe or persistent, reduce the dosage to 2.5 mg in the evening or at bedtime. Dosage Titration If tolerated and further therapeutic effect is desired, the dosage may be increased gradually to 2.5 mg one hour before lunch and 5 mg one hour before dinner. Increase the dose of dronabinol capsules gradually in order to reduce the frequency of dose-related adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Most patients respond to 2.5 mg twice daily, but the dose may be further increased to 5 mg one hour before lunch and 5 mg one hour before dinner, as tolerated to achieve a therapeutic effect. Maximum Dosage: 10 mg twice daily. 2.2 Nausea and Vomiting Associated with Cancer Chemotherapy in Adult Patients Who Failed Conventional Antiemetics Starting Dosage The recommended starting dosage of dronabinol capsules is 5 mg/m2, orally administered 1 to 3 hours prior to the administration of chemotherapy and then every 2 to 4 hours after chemotherapy, for a total of 4 to 6 doses per day. In elderly patients, consider initiating dronabinol capsules at 2.5 mg/m2 once daily 1 to 3 hours prior to chemotherapy to reduce the risk of CNS symptoms [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Administer the first dose on an empty stomach at least 30 minutes before eating. Subsequent doses can be taken without regard to meals [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The timing of dosing in relation to meal times should be kept consistent for each chemotherapy cycle, once the dosage has been determined from the titration process. Dosage Titration The dosage can be titrated to clinical response during a chemotherapy cycle or subsequent cycles, based upon initial response, as tolerated to achieve a clinical effect, in increments of 2.5 mg/m2. The maximum dosage is 15 mg/m2 per dose for 4 to 6 doses per day. Adverse reactions are dose-related and psychiatric symptoms increase significantly at the maximum dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Monitor patients for adverse reactions and consider decreasing the dose to 2.5 mg once daily 1 to 3 hours prior to chemotherapy to reduce the risk of CNS adverse reactions."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions: May cause psychiatric and cognitive effects and impair mental and/or physical abilities. Avoid use in patients with a psychiatric history. Monitor for symptoms and avoid concomitant use of drugs with similar effects. Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery until they are reasonably certain that dronabinol capsules do not affect them adversely. (5.1) Hemodynamic Instability: Patients with cardiac disorders may experience hypotension, hypertension, syncope or tachycardia. Avoid concomitant use of drugs with similar effects and monitor for hemodynamic changes after initiating or increasing the dosage of dronabinol capsules. (5.2) Seizures and Seizure-like Activity: Weigh the potential risk versus benefits before prescribing dronabinol capsules to patients with a history of seizures, including those requiring anti-epileptic medication or with other factors that lower the seizure threshold. Monitor patients and discontinue if seizures occur. (5.3) Multiple Substance Abuse: Assess risk for abuse or misuse in patients with a history of substance abuse or dependence, prior to prescribing dronabinol capsules and monitor for the development of associated behaviors or conditions. (5.4) Paradoxical Nausea, Vomiting, or Abdominal Pain: Consider dose reduction or discontinuation, if worsening of symptoms while on treatment. (5.5) 5.1 Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions Psychiatric Adverse Reactions Dronabinol has been reported to exacerbate mania, depression, or schizophrenia. Significant CNS symptoms followed oral doses of 0.4 mg/kg (28 mg per 70 kg patient) of dronabinol capsules in antiemetic studies. Prior to initiating treatment with dronabinol capsules, screen patients for a history of these illnesses. Avoid use in patients with a psychiatric history or, if the drug cannot be avoided, monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment. Also, avoid concomitant use with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects. Cognitive Adverse Reactions Use of dronabinol capsules has been associated with cognitive impairment and altered mental state. Reduce the dose of dronabinol capsules or discontinue use of dronabinol capsules if signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment develop. Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the neurological and psychoactive effects of dronabinol capsules [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4, 8.5)]. Hazardous Activities Dronabinol capsules can cause and may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks such as driving a motor vehicle or operating machinery. Concomitant use of other drugs that cause dizziness, confusion, sedation, or somnolence such as CNS depressants may increase this effect (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, ethanol, lithium, opioids, buspirone, scopolamine, antihistamines, tricyclic antidepressants, other anticholinergic agents, muscle relaxants). Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery until they are reasonably certain that dronabinol capsules do not affect them adversely. 5.2 Hemodynamic Instability Patients may experience occasional hypotension, possible hypertension, syncope, or tachycardia while taking dronabinol capsules [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Patients with cardiac disorders may be at higher risk. Avoid concomitant use of other drugs that are also associated with similar cardiac effects (e.g., amphetamines, other sympathomimetic agents, atropine, amoxapine, scopolamine, antihistamines, other anticholinergic agents, amitriptyline, desipramine, other tricyclic antidepressants). Monitor patients for changes in blood pressure, heart rate, and syncope after initiating or increasing the dosage of dronabinol capsules. 5.3 Seizures Seizure and seizure-like activity have been reported in patients receiving dronabinol. Weigh this potential risk against the benefits before prescribing dronabinol capsules to patients with a history of seizures, including those receiving anti-epileptic medication or with other factors that can lower the seizure threshold. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during dronabinol capsules therapy. If a seizure occurs, advise patients to discontinue dronabinol capsules and contact a healthcare provider immediately. 5.4 Multiple Substance Abuse Patients with a history of substance abuse or dependence, including marijuana or alcohol, may be more likely to abuse dronabinol capsules as well. Assess each patient\u2019s risk for abuse or misuse prior to prescribing dronabinol capsules and monitor patients with a history of substance abuse during treatment with dronabinol capsules for the development of these behaviors or conditions. 5.5 Paradoxical Nausea, Vomiting, or Abdominal Pain Nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain can occur during treatment with synthetic delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC), the active ingredient in dronabinol capsules. In some cases, these adverse reactions were severe (e.g., dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities) and required dose reduction or drug discontinuation. Symptoms are similar to cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS), which is described as cyclical events of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting in chronic, long-term users of delta-9-THC products. Because patients may not recognize these symptoms as abnormal, it is important to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of worsening of nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain while being treated with dronabinol capsules. Consider dose reduction or discontinuing dronabinol capsules if a patient develops worsening nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain while on treatment."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (\u22653%) are: abdominal pain, dizziness, euphoria, nausea, paranoid reaction, somnolence, thinking abnormal and vomiting. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Ascend Laboratories, LLC at 1-877-ASC-RX01 (1-877-272-7901) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling. Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Hemodynamic Instability [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Paradoxical Nausea, Vomiting, and Abdominal Pain [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Studies of AIDS-related weight loss included 157 patients receiving dronabinol capsules at a dose of 2.5 mg twice daily and 67 receiving placebo. Studies of nausea and vomiting related to cancer chemotherapy included 317 patients receiving dronabinol capsules and 68 receiving placebo. In the tables below is a summary of the adverse reactions in 474 patients exposed to dronabinol capsules in studies. Studies of different durations were combined by considering the first occurrence of events during the first 28 days. A cannabinoid dose-related \u201chigh\u201d (easy laughing, elation and heightened awareness) has been reported by patients receiving dronabinol capsules in both the antiemetic (24%) and the lower dose appetite stimulant clinical trials (8%). The most frequently reported adverse experiences in patients with AIDS during placebo-controlled clinical trials involved the CNS and were reported by 33% of patients receiving dronabinol capsules. About 25% of patients reported a CNS adverse reaction during the first 2 weeks and about 4% reported such a reaction each week for the next 6 weeks thereafter. Common Adverse Reactions The following adverse reactions were reported in clinical trials at an incidence greater than 1%. System Organ Class Adverse Reactions General Asthenia Cardiovascular Palpitations, tachycardia, vasodilation/facial flush Gastrointestinal Abdominal pain*, nausea*, vomiting* Central Nervous System Dizziness*, euphoria*, paranoid reaction*, somnolence*, thinking abnormal*, amnesia, anxiety/nervousness, ataxia, confusion, depersonalization, hallucination * Actual incidence 3% to 10% Less Common Adverse Reactions The following adverse reactions were reported in clinical trials at an incidence less than or equal to 1%. System Organ Class Adverse Reactions General Chills, headache, malaise Cardiovascular Hypotension, conjunctival injection [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] Gastrointestinal Diarrhea, fecal incontinence, anorexia, hepatic enzyme elevation Musculoskeletal Myalgias Central Nervous System Depression, nightmares, speech difficulties, tinnitus Respiratory Cough, rhinitis, sinusitis Skin Flushing, sweating Sensory Vision difficulties 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of dronabinol capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. General disorders and administration site conditions: Fatigue Hypersensitivity reactions: Lip swelling, hives, disseminated rash, oral lesions, skin burning, flushing, throat tightness [see Contraindications (4)] Injury, poisoning and procedural complications: Fall [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)] Nervous system disorders: Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] , disorientation, movement disorder, loss of consciousness Psychiatric disorders: Delirium, insomnia, panic attack Vascular disorders: Syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]"

(7.3) Highly protein-bound drugs: Potential for displacement of other drugs from plasma proteins; monitor for adverse reactions to concomitant highly protein-bound drugs and narrow therapeutic index drugs (e.g., warfarin, cyclosporine, amphotericin B) when initiating or increasing the dosage of dronabinol capsules. (7.4) 7.1 Additive CNS Effects Additive CNS effects (e.g., dizziness, confusion, sedation, somnolence) may occur when dronabinol capsules are taken concomitantly with drugs that have similar effects on the central nervous system such as CNS depressants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 7.2 Additive Cardiac Effects Additive cardiac effects (e.g., hypotension, hypertension, syncope, tachycardia) may occur when dronabinol capsules are taken concomitantly with drugs that have similar effects on the cardiovascular system [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 7.3 Effect of Other Drugs on Dronabinol Dronabinol is primarily metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 enzymes based on published in vitro studies. Inhibitors of these enzymes may increase, while inducers may decrease, the systemic exposure of dronabinol and/or its active metabolite resulting in an increase in dronabinol-related adverse reactions or loss of efficacy of dronabinol capsules. Monitor for potentially increased dronabinol-related adverse reactions when dronabinol capsules are co-administered with inhibitors of CYP2C9 (e.g., amiodarone, fluconazole) and inhibitors of CYP3A4 enzymes (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, erythromycin, grapefruit juice). 7.4 Highly Protein-Bound Drugs Dronabinol is highly bound to plasma proteins, and therefore, might displace and increase the free fraction of other concomitantly administered protein-bound drugs. Although this displacement has not been confirmed in vivo, monitor patients for increased adverse reactions to narrow therapeutic index drugs that are highly protein-bound (e.g., warfarin, cyclosporine, amphotericin B) when initiating treatment or increasing the dosage of dronabinol capsules."

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: May cause fetal harm. (8.1) Lactation: Advise HIV-infected women not to breastfeed. Advise women with nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy not to breastfeed during treatment with dronabinol capsules and for 9 days after the last dose. (8.2) Geriatric Use: Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the neuropsychiatric and postural hypotensive effects. Consider a lower starting dose in elderly patients. (2.1, 2.2, 5.1, 5.2, 8.5) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Dronabinol capsules, a synthetic cannabinoid, may cause fetal harm. Avoid use of dronabinol capsules in pregnant women. Although there is little published data on the use of synthetic cannabinoids during pregnancy, use of cannabis (e.g., marijuana) during pregnancy has been associated with adverse fetal/neonatal outcomes [see Clinical Considerations]. Cannabinoids have been found in the umbilical cord blood from pregnant women who smoke cannabis. In animal reproduction studies, no teratogenicity was reported in mice administered dronabinol at up to 30 times the MRHD (maximum recommended human dose) and up to 5 times the MRHD for patients with AIDS and cancer, respectively. Similar findings were reported in pregnant rats administered dronabinol at up to 5 to 20 times the MRHD and 3 times the MRHD for patients with AIDS and cancer, respectively. Decreased maternal weight gain and number of viable pups and increased fetal mortality and early resorptions were observed in both species at doses which induced maternal toxicity. In published studies, offspring of pregnant rats administered delta-9-THC during and after organogenesis have been reported to exhibit neurotoxicity with adverse effects on brain development, including abnormal neuronal connectivity and impairments in cognitive and motor function [see Data]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Published studies suggest that during pregnancy, the use of cannabis, which includes THC, whether for recreational or medicinal purposes, may increase the risk of adverse fetal/neonatal outcomes including fetal growth restriction, low birth weight, preterm birth, small-for-gestational age, admission to the NICU, and stillbirth. Therefore, use of cannabis during pregnancy should be avoided. Data Human Data Delta-9-THC has been measured in the cord blood of some infants whose mothers reported prenatal use of cannabis, suggesting that dronabinol may cross the placenta to the fetus during pregnancy. The effects of delta-9-THC on the fetus are not known. Animal Data Reproduction studies with dronabinol have been performed in mice at 15 to 450 mg/m 2 , equivalent to 1 to 30 times the MRHD of 15 mg/m 2 /day in AIDS patients or 0.2 to 5 times the MRHD of 90 mg/m 2 /day in cancer patients, and in rats at 74 to 295 mg/m 2 (equivalent to 5 to 20 times the MRHD of 15 mg/m 2 /day in AIDS patients or 0.8 to 3 times the MRHD of 90 mg/m 2 /day in cancer patients). These studies have revealed no evidence of teratogenicity due to dronabinol. At these dosages in mice and rats, dronabinol decreased maternal weight gain and number of viable pups and increased fetal mortality and early resorptions. Such effects were dose dependent and less apparent at lower doses that produced less maternal toxicity. Review of published literature indicates that the endocannabinoid system plays a role in neurodevelopmental processes such as neurogenesis, migration, and synaptogenesis. Exposure of pregnant rats to delta-9-THC (during and after organogenesis) may modulate these processes to result in abnormal patterns of neuronal connectivity and subsequent cognitive impairments in the offspring. Nonclinical toxicity studies in pregnant rats and newborn pups have shown prenatal exposure to THC that resulted in impairment of motor function, alteration in synaptic activity, and interference in cortical projection of neuron development in the offspring. Prenatal exposure has shown effects on cognitive function such as learning, short-and long-term memory, attention, decreased ability to remember task, and ability to discriminate between novel and same objects. Overall, prenatal exposure to THC has resulted in significant and long-term changes in brain development, cognition, and behavior in rat offspring. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary For mothers infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that HIV-infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV. Because of the potential for HIV transmission (in HIV-negative infants) and serious adverse reactions in a breastfed infant, instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving dronabinol capsules. For mothers with nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy, there are limited data on the presence of dronabinol in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The reported effects of inhaled cannabis transferred to the breastfeeding infant have been inconsistent and insufficient to establish causality. Because of the possible adverse effects from dronabinol capsules on the breastfeeding infant, advise women with nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy not to breastfeed during treatment with dronabinol capsules and for 9 days after the last dose. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of dronabinol capsules have not been established in pediatric patients. Pediatric patients may be more sensitive to neurological and psychoactive effects of dronabinol capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of dronabinol capsules in AIDS and cancer patients did not include the sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the neuropsychiatric and postural hypotensive effects of dronabinol capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]. Elderly patients with dementia are at increased risk for falls as a result of their underlying disease state, which may be exacerbated by the CNS effects of somnolence and dizziness associated with dronabinol capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. These patients should be monitored closely and placed on fall precautions prior to initiating dronabinol capsule therapy. In antiemetic studies, no difference in efficacy was apparent in patients greater than 55 years of age compared to younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of falls, decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, increased sensitivity to psychoactive effects, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)]. 8.6 Effect of CYP2C9 Polymorphism Published data suggest that systemic clearance of dronabinol may be reduced and concentrations may be increased in the presence of CYP2C9 genetic polymorphism. Monitoring for potentially increased adverse reactions is recommended in patients known to carry genetic variants associated with diminished CYP2C9 function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]."

Ingestion of high doses of dronabinol increases the risk of psychiatric adverse reactions if abused or misused, while continued administration can lead to addiction. Psychiatric adverse reactions may include psychosis, hallucinations, depersonalization, mood alteration, and paranoia. In an open-label study in patients with AIDS who received dronabinol capsules for up to five months, no abuse, diversion or systematic change in personality or social functioning were observed despite the inclusion of a substantial number of patients with a past history of drug abuse. Patients should be instructed to keep dronabinol capsules in a secure place out of reach of others for whom the medication has not been prescribed. 9.3 Dependence Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use. Physical dependence manifests by drug class-specific withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. The appearance of a withdrawal syndrome when administration of the drug is terminated is the only actual evidence of physical dependence. Physical dependence can develop during chronic therapy with dronabinol capsules, and develops after chronic abuse of marijuana. A withdrawal syndrome was reported after the abrupt discontinuation of dronabinol in subjects receiving dosages of 210 mg per day for 12 to 16 consecutive days. Within 12 hours after discontinuation, subjects manifested symptoms such as irritability, insomnia, and restlessness.

        "11 DESCRIPTION Dronabinol is a cannabinoid designated chemically as (6aR,10aR)-6a,7,8,10a-Tetrahydro-6,6,9-trimethyl-3-pentyl-6H-dibenzo[b,d]-pyran-1-ol. Dronabinol has the following empirical and structural formulas: C 21 H3 0 O 2 (molecular weight = 314.46) Dronabinol, the active ingredient in dronabinol capsules, USP, is synthetic delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC). Dronabinol is a light yellow resinous oil that is sticky at room temperature and hardens upon refrigeration. Dronabinol is insoluble in water and is formulated in sesame oil. It has a pKa of 10.6 and an octanol-water partition coefficient: 6,000:1 at pH 7. Each dronabinol capsule strength is formulated with the following inactive ingredients: 2.5 mg capsule contains gelatin, glycerin, sesame oil, and titanium dioxide; 5 mg capsule contains iron oxide red and iron oxide black, gelatin, glycerin, sesame oil, and titanium dioxide; 10 mg capsule contains iron oxide red and iron oxide yellow, gelatin, glycerin, sesame oil, and titanium dioxide."

      "clinical_pharmacology": [
        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Dronabinol is an orally active cannabinoid which has complex effects on the CNS, including central sympathomimetic activity. Cannabinoid receptors have been discovered in neural tissues. These receptors may play a role in mediating the effects of dronabinol. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on the Cardiovascular System Dronabinol-induced sympathomimetic activity may result in tachycardia and/or conjunctival injection. Its effects on blood pressure are inconsistent, but subjects have experienced orthostatic hypotension and/or syncope upon abrupt standing [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Effects on the Central Nervous System Dronabinol also demonstrates reversible effects on appetite, mood, cognition, memory, and perception. These phenomena appear to be dose-related, increasing in frequency with higher dosages, and subject to great inter-patient variability. After oral administration, dronabinol has an onset of action of approximately 0.5 to 1 hours and peak effect at 2 to 4 hours. Duration of action for psychoactive effects is 4 to 6 hours, but the appetite stimulant effect of dronabinol may continue for 24 hours or longer after administration. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance develop to some of the pharmacologic effects of dronabinol with chronic use, suggesting an indirect effect on sympathetic neurons. In a study of the pharmacodynamics of chronic dronabinol exposure, healthy male subjects (N = 12) received 210 mg per day of dronabinol capsules, administered orally in divided doses, for 16 days. An initial tachycardia induced by dronabinol was replaced successively by normal sinus rhythm and then bradycardia. A decrease in supine blood pressure, made worse by standing, was also observed initially. These subjects developed tolerance to the cardiovascular and subjective adverse CNS effects of dronabinol within 12 days of treatment initiation. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance do not appear to develop to the appetite stimulant effect of dronabinol capsules. In clinical studies involving AIDS patients, the appetite stimulant effect of dronabinol capsules was sustained for up to five months at dosages ranging from 2.5 mg to 20 mg per day. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Dronabinol (delta-9-THC) is almost completely absorbed (90 to 95%) after single oral doses. Due to the combined effects of first pass hepatic metabolism and high lipid solubility, only 10 to 20% of the administered dose reaches the systemic circulation. Concentrations of both parent drug and its major active metabolite (11-hydroxy-delta-9-THC) peak at approximately 0.5 to 4 hours after oral dosing and decline over several days. The pharmacokinetics of dronabinol after single doses (2.5, 5, and 10 mg) and multiple doses (2.5, 5, and 10 mg given twice a day) have been studied in healthy subjects. Summary of Multiple-Dose Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Dronabinol in Healthy Subjects (n=34; 20-45 years) under Fasted Conditions Mean (SD) PK Parameter Values Twice Daily Dose C max ng/mL Median T max (range), hr AUC (0-12) ng\u2022hr/mL 2.5 mg 1.32 (0.62) 1.00 (0.50-4.00) 2.88 (1.57) 5 mg 2.96 (1.81) 2.50 (0.50-4.00) 6.16 (1.85) 10 mg 7.88 (4.54) 1.50 (0.50-3.50) 15.2 (5.52) C max : maximum observed plasma concentration; T max : time to maximum observed plasma concentration; AUC (0-12) : area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 12 hours. A slight increase in dose proportionality on mean C max and AUC (0-12) of dronabinol was observed with increasing dose over the dose range studied. Effect of Food: In a published study, the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of dronabinol was studied by concomitant dosing of dronabinol capsules with a high-fat (59 grams of fat, approximately 50% of total caloric content of the meal), high calorie meal (approximately 950 calories). An appreciable food effect was observed, resulting in a 4-hour delay in mean T max and 2.9-fold increase in total exposure (AUC inf ), but C max was not significantly changed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Distribution Dronabinol has an apparent volume of distribution of approximately 10 L/kg, because of its lipid solubility. The plasma protein binding of dronabinol and its metabolites is approximately 97% [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Elimination The pharmacokinetics of dronabinol can be described using a two compartment model with an initial (alpha) half-life of about 4 hours and a terminal (beta) half-life of 25 to 36 hours. Values for clearance average about 0.2 L/kg-hr, but are highly variable due to the complexity of cannabinoid distribution. Metabolism Dronabinol undergoes extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism, primarily by hydroxylation, yielding both active and inactive metabolites. Dronabinol and its principal active metabolite, 11-hydroxy-delta-9-THC, are present in approximately equal concentrations in plasma. Published in vitro data indicates that CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 are the primary enzymes in the metabolism of dronabinol. CYP2C9 appears to be the enzyme responsible for the formation of the primary active metabolite [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]. Excretion Dronabinol and its biotransformation products are excreted in both feces and urine. Biliary excretion is the major route of elimination with about half of a radio-labeled oral dose being recovered from the feces within 72 hours as contrasted with 10 to 15% recovered from urine. Less than 5% of an oral dose is recovered unchanged in the feces. Due to its re-distribution, dronabinol and its metabolites may be excreted at low levels for prolonged periods of time. Following single dose administration, low levels of dronabinol metabolites have been detected for more than 5 weeks in the urine and feces. In a study of dronabinol capsules involving AIDS patients, urinary cannabinoid/creatinine concentration ratios were studied bi-weekly over a six week period. The urinary cannabinoid/creatinine ratio was closely correlated with dose. No increase in the cannabinoid/creatinine ratio was observed after the first two weeks of treatment, indicating that steady-state cannabinoid levels had been reached. This conclusion is consistent with predictions based on the observed terminal half-life of dronabinol. Drug Interaction Studies Formal drug-drug interaction studies have not been conducted with dronabinol. The enzyme inhibition and induction potential of dronabinol and its active metabolite are not completely understood. Published data showed an increase in the elimination half-life of pentobarbital by 4 hours when concomitantly dosed with dronabinol [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 12.5 Pharmacogenomics Published data indicate a potentially 2-to 3-fold higher dronabinol exposure in individuals carrying genetic variants associated with diminished CYP2C9 function."

        "12.1 Mechanism of Action Dronabinol is an orally active cannabinoid which has complex effects on the CNS, including central sympathomimetic activity. Cannabinoid receptors have been discovered in neural tissues. These receptors may play a role in mediating the effects of dronabinol."

      "pharmacodynamics": [
        "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on the Cardiovascular System Dronabinol-induced sympathomimetic activity may result in tachycardia and/or conjunctival injection. Its effects on blood pressure are inconsistent, but subjects have experienced orthostatic hypotension and/or syncope upon abrupt standing [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Effects on the Central Nervous System Dronabinol also demonstrates reversible effects on appetite, mood, cognition, memory, and perception. These phenomena appear to be dose-related, increasing in frequency with higher dosages, and subject to great inter-patient variability. After oral administration, dronabinol has an onset of action of approximately 0.5 to 1 hours and peak effect at 2 to 4 hours. Duration of action for psychoactive effects is 4 to 6 hours, but the appetite stimulant effect of dronabinol may continue for 24 hours or longer after administration. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance develop to some of the pharmacologic effects of dronabinol with chronic use, suggesting an indirect effect on sympathetic neurons. In a study of the pharmacodynamics of chronic dronabinol exposure, healthy male subjects (N = 12) received 210 mg per day of dronabinol capsules, administered orally in divided doses, for 16 days. An initial tachycardia induced by dronabinol was replaced successively by normal sinus rhythm and then bradycardia. A decrease in supine blood pressure, made worse by standing, was also observed initially. These subjects developed tolerance to the cardiovascular and subjective adverse CNS effects of dronabinol within 12 days of treatment initiation. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance do not appear to develop to the appetite stimulant effect of dronabinol capsules. In clinical studies involving AIDS patients, the appetite stimulant effect of dronabinol capsules was sustained for up to five months at dosages ranging from 2.5 mg to 20 mg per day."

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The effectiveness of dronabinol capsules has been established based on studies for the treatment of anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS and nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments. 14.1 Appetite Stimulation The appetite stimulant effect of dronabinol capsules in the treatment of AIDS-related anorexia associated with weight loss was studied in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving 139 patients. The initial dosage of dronabinol capsules in all patients was 5 mg/day, administered in doses of 2.5 mg one hour before lunch and one hour before dinner. In pilot studies, early morning administration of dronabinol capsules appeared to have been associated with an increased frequency of adverse experiences, as compared to dosing later in the day. The effect of dronabinol capsules on appetite, weight, mood, and nausea was measured at scheduled intervals during the six-week treatment period. Side effects (feeling high, dizziness, confusion, somnolence) occurred in 13 of 72 patients (18%) at this dosage level and the dosage was reduced to 2.5 mg/day, administered as a single dose at supper or bedtime. Of the 112 patients that completed at least 2 visits in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 99 patients had appetite data at 4-weeks (50 received dronabinol capsules and 49 received placebo) and 91 patients had appetite data at 6-weeks (46 received dronabinol capsules and 45 received placebo). A statistically significant difference between dronabinol capsules and placebo was seen in appetite as measured by the visual analog scale at weeks 4 and 6 (see figure). Trends toward improved body weight and mood, and decreases in nausea were also seen. After completing the 6-week study, patients were allowed to continue treatment with dronabinol capsules in an open-label study, in which there was a sustained improvement in appetite."

Dronabinol capsules can cause serious side effects, including: Worsening mental (psychiatric) symptoms. Psychiatric symptoms can worsen in people who have mania, depression, or schizophrenia and who take dronabinol capsules. Dronabinol capsules taken with medicines that cause psychiatric symptoms can worsen psychiatric symptoms. Elderly people who take dronabinol capsules may have a greater risk of having psychiatric symptoms. Tell your doctor if you have new or worsening mood symptoms, including symptoms of mania, depression, or schizophrenia. Problems thinking clearly. Tell your doctor if you have trouble remembering things, concentrating, have increased sleepiness, or confusion. Elderly people may have a greater risk of having problems thinking clearly. Changes in your blood pressure. Dronabinol capsules may increase or decrease your blood pressure, especially when you start taking dronabinol capsules or when your dose is changed. Tell your doctor if you have signs or symptoms of changes in your blood pressure including: headaches, vision problems, dizziness, feeling lightheaded, fainting, or a fast heartbeat. Elderly people, especially those with dementia, and people with heart problems may have an increased risk of changes in blood pressure and an increased risk of falls. What are dronabinol capsules? Dronabinol capsules are a prescription medicine used in adults to treat: loss of appetite (anorexia) in people with AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) who have lost weight. nausea and vomiting caused by anti-cancer medicine (chemotherapy) in people whose nausea and vomiting have not improved with usual anti-nausea medicines. Dronabinol capsules is a controlled substance (CIII) because it contains dronabinol, which can be a target for people who abuse prescription medicines or street drugs. Keep your dronabinol capsules in a safe place to protect it from theft. Never give your dronabinol capsules to anyone else because it may cause death or harm them. Selling or giving away this medicine is against the law. It is not known if dronabinol capsules are safe and effective in children. Do not take dronabinol capsules if you: had an allergic reaction to dronabinol. Signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction to dronabinol include: swelling of the lips, hives, a rash over your whole body, mouth sores, skin burning, flushing, and throat tightness. had an allergic reaction to sesame oil.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Probenicid decreases renal tubular secretion of amoxicillin which may result in increased blood levels of amoxicillin. ( 7.1 ) Concomitant use of Amoxicillin and oral anticoagulants may increase the prolongation of prothrombin time. ( 7.2 ) Coadministration with allopurinol increases the risk of rash. ( 7.3 ) Amoxicillin may reduce the efficacy of oral contraceptives. ( 7.4 ) 7.1 Probenecid Probenecid decreases the renal tubular secretion of amoxicillin. Concurrent use of amoxicillin and probenecid may result in increased and prolonged blood levels of amoxicillin. 7.2 Oral Anticoagulants Abnormal prolongation of prothrombin time (increased international normalized ratio [INR]) has been reported in patients receiving amoxicillin and oral anticoagulants. Appropriate monitoring should be undertaken when anticoagulants are prescribed concurrently. Adjustments in the dose of oral anticoagulants may be necessary to maintain the desired level of anticoagulation. 7.3 Allopurinol The concurrent administration of allopurinol and amoxicillin increases the incidence of rashes in patients receiving both drugs as compared to patients receiving amoxicillin alone. It is not known whether this potentiation of amoxicillin rashes is due to allopurinol or the hyperuricemia present in these patients. 7.4 Oral Contraceptives AMOXICILLIN may affect the gut flora, leading to lower estrogen reabsorption and reduced efficacy of combined oral estrogen/progesterone contraceptives. 7.5 Other Antibacterials Chloramphenicol, macrolides, sulfonamides, and tetracyclines may interfere with the bactericidal effects of penicillin. This has been demonstrated in vitro; however, the clinical significance of this interaction is not well documented. 7.6 Effects on Laboratory Tests High urine concentrations of ampicillin may result in false-positive reactions when testing for the presence of glucose in urine using CLINITEST \u00ae , Benedict\u2019s Solution, or Fehling\u2019s Solution. Since this effect may also occur with amoxicillin, it is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions (such as CLINISTIX \u00ae ) be used. Following administration of ampicillin or amoxicillin to pregnant women, a transient decrease in plasma concentration of total conjugated estriol, estriol-glucuronide, conjugated estrone, and estradiol has been noted."

        "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Studies to detect mutagenic potential of amoxicillin alone have not been conducted; however, the following information is available from tests on a 4:1 mixture of amoxicillin and potassium clavulanate (AUGMENTIN). AUGMENTIN was non-mutagenic in the Ames bacterial mutation assay, and the yeast gene conversion assay. AUGMENTIN was weakly positive in the mouse lymphoma assay, but the trend toward increased mutation frequencies in this assay occurred at doses that were also associated with decreased cell survival. AUGMENTIN was negative in the mouse micronucleus test and in the dominant lethal assay in mice. Potassium clavulanate alone was tested in the Ames bacterial mutation assay and in the mouse micronucleus test, and was negative in each of these assays. In a multi generation reproduction study in rats, no impairment of fertility or other adverse reproductive effects were seen at doses up to 500 mg/kg (approximately 2 times the 3 g human dose based on body surface area)."

        "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE AMOXICILLIN is a penicillin-class antibacterial indicated for treatment of infections due to susceptible strains of designated microorganisms. Infections of the ear, nose, throat, genitourinary tract, skin and skin structure, and lower respiratory tract. ( 1.1 \u2013 1.4 ) In combination for treatment of H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer disease. ( 1.5 ) To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of AMOXICILLIN and other antibacterial drugs, AMOXICILLIN should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria. ( 1.6 ) 1.1 Infections of the Ear, Nose, and Throat AMOXICILLIN is indicated in the treatment of infections due to susceptible (ONLY \u03b2-lactamase\u2013negative) isolates of Streptococcus species. (\u03b1 and \u03b2 hemolytic isolates only), Streptococcus pneumoniae , Staphylococcus spp., or Haemophilus influenzae . 1.2 Infections of the Genitourinary Tract AMOXICILLIN is indicated in the treatment of infections due to susceptible (ONLY \u03b2-lactamase\u2013negative) isolates of Escherichia coli , Proteus mirabilis , or Enterococcus faecalis . 1.3 Infections of the Skin and Skin Structure AMOXICILLIN is indicated in the treatment of infections due to susceptible (ONLY \u03b2-lactamase\u2013negative) isolates of Streptococcus spp. (\u03b1 and \u03b2 hemolytic isolates only), Staphylococcus spp., or E. coli. 1.4 Infections of the Lower Respiratory Tract AMOXICILLIN is indicated in the treatment of infections due to susceptible (ONLY \u03b2-lactamase\u2013negative) isolates of Streptococcus spp. (\u03b1 and \u03b2 hemolytic isolates only), S. pneumoniae , S taphylococcus spp ., or H. influenzae . 1.5 Helicobacter pylori Infection Triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori with clarithromycin and lansoprazole: AMOXICILLIN, in combination with clarithromycin plus lansoprazole as triple therapy, is indicated for the treatment of patients with H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer disease (active or 1 year history of a duodenal ulcer) to eradicate H. pylori . Eradication of H. pylori has been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence. Dual therapy for H. pylori with lansoprazole : AMOXICILLIN, in combination with lansoprazole delayed release capsules as dual therapy, is indicated for the treatment of patients with H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer disease (active or 1 year history of a duodenal ulcer) who are either allergic or intolerant to clarithromycin or in whom resistance to clarithromycin is known or suspected . (See the clarithromycin package insert, MICROBIOLOGY.) Eradication of H. pylori has been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence. 1.6 Usage To reduce the development of drug resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of AMOXICILLIN and other antibacterial drugs, AMOXICILLIN should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylactic reactions: Serious and occasionally fatal anaphylactic reactions have been reported in patients on penicillin therapy. Serious anaphylactic reactions require immediate emergency treatment with supportive measures. ( 5.1 ) Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea (ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis): Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Anaphylactic Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients on penicillin therapy including amoxicillin. Although anaphylaxis is more frequent following parenteral therapy, it has occurred in patients on oral penicillins. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe reactions when treated with cephalosporins. Before initiating therapy with AMOXICILLIN, careful inquiry should be made regarding previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, or other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, AMOXICILLIN should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.2 Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including AMOXICILLIN, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing AMOXICILLIN in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.4 Use in Patients With Mononucleosis A high percentage of patients with mononucleosis who receive amoxicillin develop an erythematous skin rash. Thus amoxicillin should not be administered to patients with mononucleosis. 5.5 Phenylketonurics Amoxicillin chewable tablets contain aspartame which contains phenylalanine. Each 200 mg chewable tablet contains 1.82 mg phenylalanine; each 400 mg chewable tablet contains 3.64 mg phenylalanine. The oral suspensions of Amoxicillin do not contain phenylalanine and can be used by phenylketonurics."

        "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION In adults, 750-1750 mg/day in divided doses every 8-12 hours. In Pediatric Patients > 3 Months of Age, 20-45 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 8-12 hours. Refer to full prescribing information for specific dosing regimens. ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.3 ) The upper dose for neonates and infants \u2264 3 months is 30 mg/kg/day divided every 12 hours. ( 2.2 ) Dosing for H. pylori Infection: Triple therapy: 1 gram AMOXICILLIN, 500 mg clarithromycin, and 30 mg lansoprazole, all given twice daily (every 12 hours) for 14 days. Dual therapy: 1 gram AMOXICILLIN and 30 mg lansoprazole, each given three times daily (every 8 hours) for 14 days. ( 2.3 ) Reduce the dose in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR <30 mL/min). ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Dosing for Adult and Pediatric Patients > 3 Months of Age Treatment should be continued for a minimum of 48 to 72 hours beyond the time that the patient becomes asymptomatic or evidence of bacterial eradication has been obtained. It is recommended that there be at least 10 days treatment for any infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes to prevent the occurrence of acute rheumatic fever. In some infections, therapy may be required for several weeks. It may be necessary to continue clinical and/or bacteriological follow-up for several months after cessation of therapy. Table 1. Dosing Recommendations for Adult and Pediatric Patients > 3 Months of Age Infection Severity a Usual Adult Dose Usual Dose for Children > 3 Months b Ear/Nose/Throat Skin/Skin Structure Genitourinary Tract Mild/Moderate 500 mg every 12 hours or 250 mg every 8 hours 25 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 12 hours or 20 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 8 hours Severe 875 mg every 12 hours or 500 mg every 8 hours 45 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 12 hours or 40 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 8 hours Lower Respiratory Tract Mild/Moderate or Severe 875 mg every 12 hours or 500 mg every 8 hours 45 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 12 hours or 40 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 8 hours a Dosing for infections caused by bacteria that are intermediate in their susceptibility to amoxicillin should follow the recommendations for severe infections. b The children\u2019s dosage is intended for individuals whose weight is less than 40 kg. Children weighing 40 kg or more should be dosed according to the adult recommendations. 2.2 Dosing in Neonates and Infants Aged \u2264 12 Weeks (\u2264 3 Months) Treatment should be continued for a minimum of 48 to 72 hours beyond the time that the patient becomes asymptomatic or evidence of bacterial eradication has been obtained. It is recommended that there be at least 10 days\u2019 treatment for any infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes to prevent the occurrence of acute rheumatic fever. Due to incompletely developed renal function affecting elimination of amoxicillin in this age group, the recommended upper dose of AMOXICILLIN is 30 mg/kg/day divided every 12 hours. There are currently no dosing recommendations for pediatric patients with impaired renal function. 2.3 Dosing for H. pylori Infection Triple therapy: The recommended adult oral dose is 1 gram AMOXICILLIN, 500 mg clarithromycin, and 30 mg lansoprazole, all given twice daily (every 12 hours) for 14 days. Dual therapy: The recommended adult oral dose is 1 gram AMOXICILLIN and 30 mg lansoprazole, each given three times daily (every 8 hours) for 14 days. Please refer to clarithromycin and lansoprazole full prescribing information. 2.4 Dosing in Renal Impairment Patients with impaired renal function do not generally require a reduction in dose unless the impairment is severe. Severely impaired patients with a glomerular filtration rate of < 30 mL/min. should not receive a 875 mg dose. Patients with a glomerular filtration rate of 10 to 30 mL/min should receive 500 mg or 250 mg every 12 hours, depending on the severity of the infection. Patients with a glomerular filtration rate less than 10 mL/min should receive 500 mg or 250 mg every 24 hours, depending on severity of the infection. Hemodialysis patients should receive 500 mg or 250 mg every 24 hours, depending on severity of the infection. They should receive an additional dose both during and at the end of dialysis. 2.5 Directions for Mixing Oral Suspension Tap bottle until all powder flows freely.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: Anaphylactic reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] CDAD [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] The most common adverse reactions (> 1%) observed in clinical trials of AMOXICILLIN capsules, tablets or oral suspension were diarrhea, rash, vomiting, and nausea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories Inc., at 1-888-375-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions (> 1%) observed in clinical trials of AMOXICILLIN capsules, tablets or oral suspension were diarrhea, rash, vomiting, and nausea. Triple therapy: The most frequently reported adverse events for patients who received triple therapy (amoxicillin/clarithromycin/ lansoprazole) were diarrhea (7%), headache (6%), and taste perversion (5%). Dual therapy: The most frequently reported adverse events for patients who received double therapy amoxicillin/lansoprazole were diarrhea (8%) and headache (7%). For more information on adverse reactions with clarithromycin or lansoprazole, refer to the Adverse Reactions section of their package inserts. 6.2 Postmarketing or Other Experience In addition to adverse events reported from clinical trials, the following events have been identified during postmarketing use of penicillins. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to AMOXICILLIN. Infections and Infestations: Mucocutaneous candidiasis. Gastrointestinal: Black hairy tongue, and hemorrhagic/pseudomembranous colitis. Onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibacterial treatment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Hypersensitivity Reactions: Anaphylaxis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] .Serum sickness\u2013like reactions, erythematous maculopapular rashes, erythema multiforme, Stevens Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, hypersensitivity vasculitis, and urticaria have been reported . Liver: A moderate rise in AST and/or ALT has been noted, but the significance of this finding is unknown. Hepatic dysfunction including cholestatic jaundice, hepatic cholestasis and acute cytolytic hepatitis have been reported . Renal: Crystalluria has been reported [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Hemic and Lymphatic Systems: Anemia, including hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura, eosinophilia, leukopenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported . These reactions are usually reversible on discontinuation of therapy and are believed to be hypersensitivity phenomena. Central Nervous System: Reversible hyperactivity, agitation, anxiety, insomnia, confusion, convulsions, behavioral changes, and/or dizziness have been reported . Miscellaneous: Tooth discoloration (brown, yellow, or gray staining) has been reported . Most reports occurred in pediatric patients. Discoloration was reduced or eliminated with brushing or dental cleaning in most cases."

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pediatric: Modify dose in patients 12 weeks or younger ( \u22643 months). ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies have been performed in mice and rats at doses up to 2000 mg/kg (3 and 6 times the 3 g human dose, based on body surface area). There was no evidence of harm to the fetus due to amoxicillin. There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, amoxicillin should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. 8.2 Labor and Delivery Oral ampicillin is poorly absorbed during labor. It is not known whether use of amoxicillin in humans during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus, prolongs the duration of labor, or increases the likelihood of the necessity for an obstetrical intervention. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Penicillins have been shown to be excreted in human milk. Amoxicillin use by nursing mothers may lead to sensitization of infants. Caution should be exercised when amoxicillin is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use Because of incompletely developed renal function in neonates and young infants, the elimination of amoxicillin may be delayed. Dosing of AMOXICILLIN should be modified in pediatric patients 12 weeks or younger (\u2264 3 months). [ See Dosage and Administration( 2.2 ). ] 8.5 Geriatric Use An analysis of clinical studies of AMOXICILLIN was conducted to determine whether subjects aged 65 and over respond differently from younger subjects. These analyses have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but a greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 8.6 Dosing in Renal Impairment Amoxicillin is primarily eliminated by the kidney and dosage adjustment is usually required in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR <30 mL/min). See Dosing in Renal Impairment ( 2.4 ) for specific recommendations in patients with renal impairment."

        "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Information for Patients Patients should be advised that AMOXICILLIN may be taken every 8 hours or every 12 hours, depending on the dose prescribed. Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including AMOXICILLIN, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When AMOXICILLIN is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may: (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment, and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by AMOXICILLIN or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Patients should be counseled that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics, and it usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as 2 or more months after having taken their last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Patients should be aware that AMOXICILLIN contains a penicillin class drug product that can cause allergic reactions in some individuals.

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 H. pylori Eradication to Reduce the Risk of Duodenal Ulcer Recurrence Randomized, double-blind clinical studies performed in the United States in patients with H. pylori and duodenal ulcer disease (defined as an active ulcer or history of an ulcer within 1 year) evaluated the efficacy of lansoprazole in combination with amoxicillin capsules and clarithromycin tablets as triple 14 day therapy, or in combination with amoxicillin capsules as dual 14 day therapy, for the eradication of H. pylori. Based on the results of these studies, the safety and efficacy of 2 different eradication regimens were established: Triple therapy : Amoxicillin 1 gram twice daily/clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily/lansoprazole 30 mg twice daily (see Table 6) . Dual therapy : Amoxicillin 1 gram three times daily/lansoprazole 30 mg three times daily (see Table 7) . All treatments were for 14 days. H. pylori eradication was defined as 2 negative tests (culture and histology) at 4 to 6 weeks following the end of treatment. Triple therapy was shown to be more effective than all possible dual therapy combinations. Dual therapy was shown to be more effective than both monotherapies. Eradication of H. pylori has been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence. Table 6.

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Amoxicillin is an antibacterial drug. [ see Microbiology ( 12.4 ) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: Amoxicillin is stable in the presence of gastric acid and is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. The effect of food on the absorption of amoxicillin from the tablets and suspension of AMOXICILLIN has been partially investigated; 400 mg and 875 mg formulations have been studied only when administered at the start of a light meal. Orally administered doses of 250 mg and 500 mg amoxicillin capsules result in average peak blood levels 1 to 2 hours after administration in the range of 3.5 mcg/mL to 5.0 mcg/mL and 5.5 mcg/mL to 7.5 mcg/mL, respectively. Mean amoxicillin pharmacokinetic parameters from an open, two part , single dose crossover bioequivalence study in 27 adults comparing 875 mg of AMOXICILLIN with 875 mg of AUGMENTIN\u00ae (amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium) showed that the 875 mg tablet of Amoxicillin produces an AUC 0-\u221e of 35.4 \u00b1 8.1 mcg\u2022hr/mL and a C max of 13.8 \u00b1 4.1 mcg/mL. Dosing was at the start of a light meal following an overnight fast. Orally administered doses of amoxicillin suspension, 125 mg/5 mL and 250 mg/5 mL, result in average peak blood levels 1 to 2 hours after administration in the range of 1.5 mcg/mL to 3.0 mcg/mL and 3.5 mcg/mL to 5.0 mcg/mL, respectively. Oral administration of single doses of 400 mg chewable tablets and 400 mg/5 mL suspension of AMOXICILLIN to 24 adult volunteers yielded comparable pharmacokinetic data: Table 3: Mean Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Amoxicillin (400 mg chewable tablets and 400 mg/5 mL suspension) in Healthy Adults: Dose Administered at the start of a light meal. AUC 0-\u221e (mcg\u2022hr/mL) C max (mcg/mL) Mean values of 24 normal volunteers. Peak concentrations occurred approximately 1 hour after the dose. Amoxicillin Amoxicillin (\u00b1S.D.) Amoxicillin (\u00b1S.D.) 400 mg (5 mL of suspension) 17.1 (3.1) 5.92 (1.62) 400 mg (1 chewable tablet) 17.9 (2.4) 5.18 (1.64) Distribution: Amoxicillin diffuses readily into most body tissues and fluids, with the exception of brain and spinal fluid, except when meninges are inflamed. In blood serum, amoxicillin is approximately 20% protein bound. Following a 1 gram dose and utilizing a special skin window technique to determine levels of the antibiotic, it was noted that therapeutic levels were found in the interstitial fluid. Metabolism and Excretion: The half-life of amoxicillin is 61.3 minutes. Approximately 60% of an orally administered dose of amoxicillin is excreted in the urine within 6 to 8 hours. Detectable serum levels are observed up to 8 hours after an orally administered dose of amoxicillin. Since most of the amoxicillin is excreted unchanged in the urine, its excretion can be delayed by concurrent administration of probenecid [see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7.1 )]. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Amoxicillin is similar to penicillin in its bactericidal action against susceptible bacteria during the stage of active multiplication. It acts through the inhibition of cell wall biosynthesis that leads to the death of the bacteria. Mechanism of Resistance Resistance to amoxicillin is mediated primarily through enzymes called beta-lactamases that cleave the beta-lactam ring of amoxicillin, rendering it inactive. Amoxicillin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the bacteria listed below, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section. Gram-Positive Bacteria Enterococcus faecalis Staphylococcus spp. Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus spp. (alpha and beta-hemolytic) Gram-Negative Bacteria Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Helicobacter pylori Proteus mirabilis Susceptibility Test Methods: When available, the clinical microbiology laboratory should provide cumulative in vitro susceptibility test results for antimicrobial drugs used in local hospitals and practice areas to the physician as periodic reports that describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens. These reports should aid the physician in selecting the most effective antimicrobial. Dilution Techniques: Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized test method -(broth or agar) 2,4 . The MIC values should be interpreted according to the criteria in Table 4. Diffusion Techniques: Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters can also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds 3,4 . The zone size should be determined using a standardized test method 3 . Susceptibility to amoxicillin of Enterococcus spp., Enterobacteriaceae, and H. influenzae , may be inferred by testing ampicillin 4 . Susceptibility to amoxicillin \u200b of Staphylococcus spp., and beta-hemolytic Streptococcus spp., may be inferred by testing penicillin 4 . The majority of isolates of Enterococcus spp. that are resistant to ampicillin or amoxicillin produce a TEM-type beta-lactamase. A beta-lactamase test can provide a rapid means of determining resistance to ampicillin and amoxicillin 4 . Susceptibility to amoxicillin of Streptococcus pneumoniae (non-meningitis isolates) may be inferred by testing penicillin or oxacillin 4 . The interpretive criteria for S. pneumoniae to amoxicillin are provided in Table 4 4 . Table 4. Susceptibility Interpretive Criteria for Amoxicillin Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (mcg/mL) Disk Diffusion (zone diameter in mm) Streptococcus pneumoniae (non-meningitis isolates)* Susceptible Intermediate Resistant Susceptible Intermediate Resistant \u2264 2 4 \u2265 8 -- -- -- * S. pneumoniae should be tested using a 1 mcg oxacillin disk. Isolates with oxacillin zone sizes of \u2265 20 mm are susceptible to amoxicillin. An amoxicillin MIC should be determined on isolates of S. pneumoniae with oxacillin zone sizes of \u2264 19 mm4. A report of \"Susceptible\" indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable. A report of \"Intermediate\" indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone, which prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of \"Resistant\" indicates that the pathogen is not likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable; other therapy should be selected. Susceptibility Testing for Helicobacter pylori Amoxicillin in vitro susceptibility testing methods for determining minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and zone sizes have not been standardized, validated, or approved for testing H. pylori. Specimens for H. pylori and clarithromycin susceptibility test results should be obtained on isolates from patients who fail triple therapy. If clarithromycin resistance is found, a non-clarithromycin-containing regimen should be used. Quality Control: Standardized susceptibility test procedures 2,3,4 require use of laboratory controls to monitor and ensure the accuracy and precision of the supplies and reagents used in the assay, and the techniques of the individuals performing the test control. Standard amoxicillin powder should provide the following range of MIC values provided in Table 5 4 . For the diffusion technique the criteria provided in Table 5 should be achieved. Table 5.

        "10 OVERDOSAGE In case of overdosage, discontinue medication, treat symptomatically, and institute supportive measures as required. A prospective study of 51 pediatric patients at a poison-control center suggested that overdosages of less than 250 mg/kg of amoxicillin are not associated with significant clinical symptoms. Interstitial nephritis resulting in oliguric renal failure has been reported in a small number of patients after overdosage with amoxicillin1. Crystalluria, in some cases leading to renal failure, has also been reported after amoxicillin overdosage in adult and pediatric patients. In case of overdosage, adequate fluid intake and diuresis should be maintained to reduce the risk of amoxicillin crystalluria. Renal impairment appears to be reversible with cessation of drug administration. High blood levels may occur more readily in patients with impaired renal function because of decreased renal clearance of amoxicillin. Amoxicillin may be removed from circulation by hemodialysis."

        "Drug Interactions The pharmacokinetic interactions listed below are potentially clinically important. Mutual inhibition of metabolism occurs with concurrent use of cyclosporin and methylprednisolone; therefore, it is possible that adverse events associated with the individual use of either drug may be more apt to occur. Convulsions have been reported with concurrent use of methylprednisolone and cyclosporin. Drugs that induce hepatic enzymes such as phenobarbital, phenytoin and rifampin may increase the clearance of methylprednisolone and may require increases in methylprednisolone dose to achieve the desired response. Drugs such as troleandomycin and ketoconazole may inhibit the metabolism of methylprednisolone and thus decrease its clearance. Therefore, the dose of methylprednisolone should be titrated to avoid steroid toxicity. Methylprednisolone may increase the clearance of chronic high dose aspirin. This could lead to decreased salicylate serum levels or increase the risk of salicylate toxicity when methylprednisolone is withdrawn. Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in patients suffering from hypoprothrombinemia. The effect of methylprednisolone on oral anticoagulants is variable. There are reports of enhanced as well as diminished effects of anticoagulant when given concurrently with corticosteroids. Therefore, coagulation indices should be monitored to maintain the desired anticoagulant effect."

        "PRECAUTIONS General Precautions Drug-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt and/or a mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently. There is an enhanced effect of corticosteroids on patients with hypothyroidism and in those with cirrhosis. Corticosteroids should be used cautiously in patients with ocular herpes simplex because of possible corneal perforation. The lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition under treatment, and when reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual. Psychic derangements may appear when corticosteroids are used, ranging from euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, and severe depression, to frank psychotic manifestations. Also, existing emotional instability or psychotic tendencies may be aggravated by corticosteroids. Steroids should be used with caution in nonspecific ulcerative colitis, if there is a probability of impending perforation, abscess or other pyogenic infection; diverticulitis; fresh intestinal anastomoses; active or latent peptic ulcer; renal insufficiency; hypertension; osteoporosis; and myasthenia gravis. Growth and development of infants and children on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should be carefully observed. Kaposi's sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical remission. Although controlled clinical trials have shown corticosteroids to be effective in speeding the resolution of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, they do not show that corticosteroids affect the ultimate outcome or natural history of the disease. The studies do show that relatively high doses of corticosteroids are necessary to demonstrate a significant effect. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Since complications of treatment with glucocorticoids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, a risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used.

        "DESCRIPTION MEDROL Tablets contain methylprednisolone which is a glucocorticoid. Glucocorticoids are adrenocortical steroids, both naturally occurring and synthetic, which are readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Methylprednisolone occurs as a white to practically white, odorless, crystalline powder. It is sparingly soluble in alcohol, in dioxane, and in methanol, slightly soluble in acetone, and in chloroform, and very slightly soluble in ether. It is practically insoluble in water. The chemical name for methylprednisolone is pregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione, 11,17,21-trihydroxy-6-methyl-, (6\u03b1,11\u03b2)-and the molecular weight is 374.48. The structural formula is represented below: Each MEDROL Tablet for oral administration contains 2 mg, 4 mg, 8 mg, 16 mg or 32 mg of methylprednisolone. Inactive ingredients: 2 mg 4 mg and 8 mg Calcium Stearate Calcium Stearate Corn Starch Corn Starch Erythrosine Sodium Lactose Lactose Sucrose Mineral Oil Sorbic Acid Sucrose 16 mg and 32 mg Calcium Stearate Corn Starch Lactose Mineral Oil Sucrose Chemical Structure ACTIONS Naturally occurring glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone and cortisone), which also have salt-retaining properties, are used as replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states. Their synthetic analogs are primarily used for their potent anti-inflammatory effects in disorders of many organ systems. Glucocorticoids cause profound and varied metabolic effects. In addition, they modify the body's immune responses to diverse stimuli."

        "WARNINGS In patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to unusual stress, increased dosage of rapidly acting corticosteroids before, during, and after the stressful situation is indicated. Corticosteroids may mask some signs of infection, and new infections may appear during their use. Infections with any pathogen including viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan or helminthic infections, in any location of the body, may be associated with the use of corticosteroids alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive agents that affect cellular immunity, humoral immunity, or neutrophil function. 1 These infections may be mild, but can be severe and at times fatal. With increasing doses of corticosteroids, the rate of occurrence of infectious complications increases. 2 There may be decreased resistance and inability to localize infection when corticosteroids are used. Prolonged use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to fungi or viruses. Usage in pregnancy Since adequate human reproduction studies have not been done with corticosteroids, the use of these drugs in pregnancy, nursing mothers or women of child-bearing potential requires that the possible benefits of the drug be weighed against the potential hazards to the mother and embryo or fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy, should be carefully observed for signs of hypoadrenalism. Average and large doses of hydrocortisone or cortisone can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion. Administration of live or live, attenuated vaccines is contraindicated in patients receiving immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids. Killed or inactivated vaccines may be administered to patients receiving immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids; however, the response to such vaccines may be diminished. Indicated immunization procedures may be undertaken in patients receiving nonimmunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids. The use of MEDROL Tablets in active tuberculosis should be restricted to those cases of fulminating or disseminated tuberculosis in which the corticosteroid is used for the management of the disease in conjunction with an appropriate antituberculous regimen. If corticosteroids are indicated in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, close observation is necessary as reactivation of the disease may occur. During prolonged corticosteroid therapy, these patients should receive chemoprophylaxis. Persons who are on drugs which suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chicken pox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in non-immune children or adults on corticosteroids. In such children or adults who have not had these diseases particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route and duration of corticosteroid administration affects the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed, to chicken pox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chicken pox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. Similarly, corticosteroids should be used with great care in patients with known or suspected Strongyloides (threadworm) infestation. In such patients, corticosteroid-induced immunosuppression may lead to Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied by severe enterocolitis and potentially fatal gram-negative septicemia."

        "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The initial dosage of MEDROL Tablets may vary from 4 mg to 48 mg of methylprednisolone per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, MEDROL should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment; in this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of MEDROL for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. Multiple Sclerosis In treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective (4 mg of methylprednisolone is equivalent to 5 mg of prednisolone). ADT \u00ae (Alternate Day Therapy) Alternate day therapy is a corticosteroid dosing regimen in which twice the usual daily dose of corticoid is administered every other morning. The purpose of this mode of therapy is to provide the patient requiring long-term pharmacologic dose treatment with the beneficial effects of corticoids while minimizing certain undesirable effects, including pituitary-adrenal suppression, the Cushingoid state, corticoid withdrawal symptoms, and growth suppression in children. The rationale for this treatment schedule is based on two major premises: (a) the anti-inflammatory or therapeutic effect of corticoids persists longer than their physical presence and metabolic effects and (b) administration of the corticosteroid every other morning allows for reestablishment of more nearly normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity on the off-steroid day. A brief review of the HPA physiology may be helpful in understanding this rationale. Acting primarily through the hypothalamus a fall in free cortisol stimulates the pituitary gland to produce increasing amounts of corticotropin (ACTH) while a rise in free cortisol inhibits ACTH secretion. Normally the HPA system is characterized by diurnal (circadian) rhythm. Serum levels of ACTH rise from a low point about 10 pm to a peak level about 6 am. Increasing levels of ACTH stimulate adrenal cortical activity resulting in a rise in plasma cortisol with maximal levels occurring between 2 am and 8 am. This rise in cortisol dampens ACTH production and in turn adrenal cortical activity. There is a gradual fall in plasma corticoids during the day with lowest levels occurring about midnight. The diurnal rhythm of the HPA axis is lost in Cushing's disease, a syndrome of adrenal cortical hyperfunction characterized by obesity with centripetal fat distribution, thinning of the skin with easy bruisability, muscle wasting with weakness, hypertension, latent diabetes, osteoporosis, electrolyte imbalance, etc. The same clinical findings of hyperadrenocorticism may be noted during long-term pharmacologic dose corticoid therapy administered in conventional daily divided doses. It would appear, then, that a disturbance in the diurnal cycle with maintenance of elevated corticoid values during the night may play a significant role in the development of undesirable corticoid effects. Escape from these constantly elevated plasma levels for even short periods of time may be instrumental in protecting against undesirable pharmacologic effects. During conventional pharmacologic dose corticosteroid therapy, ACTH production is inhibited with subsequent suppression of cortisol production by the adrenal cortex. Recovery time for normal HPA activity is variable depending upon the dose and duration of treatment. During this time the patient is vulnerable to any stressful situation. Although it has been shown that there is considerably less adrenal suppression following a single morning dose of prednisolone (10 mg) as opposed to a quarter of that dose administered every six hours, there is evidence that some suppressive effect on adrenal activity may be carried over into the following day when pharmacologic doses are used. Further, it has been shown that a single dose of certain corticosteroids will produce adrenal cortical suppression for two or more days. Other corticoids, including methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone, prednisone, and prednisolone, are considered to be short acting (producing adrenal cortical suppression for 1\u00bc to 1\u00bd days following a single dose) and thus are recommended for alternate day therapy. The following should be kept in mind when considering alternate day therapy: 1) Basic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should apply. The benefits of ADT should not encourage the indiscriminate use of steroids. 2) ADT is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for patients in whom long-term pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated. 3) In less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated, it may be possible to initiate treatment with ADT. More severe disease states usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initial control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should be continued until satisfactory clinical response is obtained, usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases. It is important to keep the period of initial suppressive dose as brief as possible particularly when subsequent use of alternate day therapy is intended. Once control has been established, two courses are available: (a) change to ADT and then gradually reduce the amount of corticoid given every other day or (b) following control of the disease process reduce the daily dose of corticoid to the lowest effective level as rapidly as possible and then change over to an alternate day schedule. Theoretically, course (a) may be preferable. 4) Because of the advantages of ADT, it may be desirable to try patients on this form of therapy who have been on daily corticoids for long periods of time (eg, patients with rheumatoid arthritis). Since these patients may already have a suppressed HPA axis, establishing them on ADT may be difficult and not always successful. However, it is recommended that regular attempts be made to change them over. It may be helpful to triple or even quadruple the daily maintenance dose and administer this every other day rather than just doubling the daily dose if difficulty is encountered. Once the patient is again controlled, an attempt should be made to reduce this dose to a minimum. 5) As indicated above, certain corticosteroids, because of their prolonged suppressive effect on adrenal activity, are not recommended for alternate day therapy (eg, dexamethasone and betamethasone). 6) The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between 2 am and 8 am, and it is minimal between 4 pm and midnight. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocortical activity the least, when given at the time of maximal activity (am). 7) In using ADT it is important, as in all therapeutic situations to individualize and tailor the therapy to each patient. Complete control of symptoms will not be possible in all patients. An explanation of the benefits of ADT will help the patient to understand and tolerate the possible flare-up in symptoms which may occur in the latter part of the off-steroid day. Other symptomatic therapy may be added or increased at this time if needed. 8) In the event of an acute flare-up of the disease process, it may be necessary to return to a full suppressive daily divided corticoid dose for control. Once control is again established alternate day therapy may be reinstituted. 9) Although many of the undesirable features of corticosteroid therapy can be minimized by ADT, as in any therapeutic situation, the physician must carefully weigh the benefit-risk ratio for each patient in whom corticoid therapy is being considered."

      "precautions": [
        "PRECAUTIONS General Aortic Stenosis/Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Impaired Renal Function As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe congestive heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including lisinopril, may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and rarely with acute renal failure and/or death. In hypertensive patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine may occur. Experience with another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor suggests that these increases are usually reversible upon discontinuation of lisinopril and/or diuretic therapy. In such patients, renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy. Some patients with hypertension or heart failure with no apparent preexisting renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially when lisinopril has been given concomitantly with a diuretic. This is more likely to occur in patients with preexisting renal impairment. Dosage reduction and/or discontinuation of the diuretic and/or lisinopril may be required. Patients with acute myocardial infarction in the GISSI-3 trial treated with lisinopril had a higher (2.4% vs. 1.1%) incidence of renal dysfunction in-hospital and at six weeks (increasing creatinine concentration to over 3 mg/dL or a doubling or more of the baseline serum creatinine concentration). In acute myocardial infarction, treatment with lisinopril should be initiated with caution in patients with evidence of renal dysfunction, defined as serum creatinine concentration exceeding 2 mg/dL. If renal dysfunction develops during treatment with lisinopril (serum creatinine concentration exceeding 3 mg/dL or a doubling from the pre-treatment value) then the physician should consider withdrawal of lisinopril. Evaluation of patients with hypertension, heart failure, or myocardial infarction should always include assessment of renal function (seeDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Hyperkalemia In clinical trials hyperkalemia (serum potassium greater than 5.7 mEq/L) occurred in approximately 2.2% of hypertensive patients and 4.8% of patients with heart failure. In most cases these were isolated values which resolved despite continued therapy. Hyperkalemia was a cause of discontinuation of therapy in approximately 0.1% of hypertensive patients, 0.6% of patients with heart failure and 0.1% of patients with myocardial infarction. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes. Hyperkalemia can cause serious, sometimes fatal, arrhythmias. Lisinopril should be used cautiously, if at all, with these agents and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). Cough Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, almost always resolving after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough. Surgery/Anesthesia In patients undergoing major surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, lisinopril may block angiotensin II formation secondary to compensatory renin release. If hypotension occurs and is considered to be due to this mechanism, it can be corrected by volume expansion. Information for Patients Angioedema Angioedema, including laryngeal edema, may occur at any time during treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including lisinopril. Patients should be so advised and told to report immediately any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema (swelling of face, extremities, eyes, lips, tongue, difficulty in swallowing or breathing) and to take no more drug until they have consulted with the prescribing physician.< Symptomatic Hypotension Patients should be cautioned to report lightheadedness especially during the first few days of therapy. If actual syncope occurs, the patient should be told to discontinue the drug until they have consulted with the prescribing physician. All patients should be cautioned that excessive perspiration and dehydration may lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure because of reduction in fluid volume. Other causes of volume depletion such as vimiting or diarrhea may also lead to a fall in blood pressure; patients should be advised to consult with their physician. Hyperkalemia Patients should be told not to use salt substitutes containing potassium without consulting their physician. Hypoglycemia Diabetic patients treated with oral antidiabetic agents or insulin starting an ACE inhibitor should be told to closely monitor for hypoglycemia, especially during the first month of combined use (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). Leukopenia/Neutropenia Patients should be told to report promptly any indication of infection (e.g., sore throat, fever) which may be a sign of leukopenia/neutropenia. Pregnancy Female patients of childbearing age should be told about the consequences of exposure to lisinopril during pregnancy. Discuss treatment options with women planning to become pregnant. Patients should be asked to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible. NOTE :As with many other drugs, certain advice to patients being treated with lisinopril is warranted. This information is intended to aid in the safe and effective use of this medication. It is not a disclosure of all possible adverse or intended effects. Drug Interactions Hypotension-Patients on Diuretic Therapy Patients on diuretics and especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with lisinopril. The possibility of hypotensive effects with lisinopril can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with lisinopril. If it is necessary to continue the diuretic, initiate therapy with lisinopril at a dose of 5 mg daily, and provide close medical supervision after the initial dose until blood pressure has stabilized (see WARNINGSand DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). When a diuretic is added to the therapy of a patient receiving lisinopril, an additional antihypertensive effect is usually observed. Studies with ACE inhibitors in combination with diuretics indicate that the dose of the ACE inhibitor can be reduced when it is given with a diuretic (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Antidiabetics Epidemiological studies have suggested that concomitant administration of ACE inhibitors and antidiabetic medicines (insulins, oral hypoglycemic agents) may cause an increased blood-glucose-lowering effect with risk of hypoglycemia. This phenomenon appeared to be more likely to occur during the first weeks of combined treatment and in patients with renal impairment. In diabetic patients treated with oral antidiabetic agents or insulin, glycemic control should be closely monitored for hypoglycemia, especially during the first month of treatment with an ACE inhibitor. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including lisinopril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving lisinopril and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including lisinopril, may be attenuated by NSAIDs. Other Agents Lisinopril has been used concomitantly with nitrates and/or digoxin without evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions. This included post myocardial infarction patients who were receiving intravenous or transdermal nitroglycerin. No clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions occurred when lisinopril was used concomitantly with propranolol or hydrochlorothiazide. The presence of food in the stomach does not alter the bioavailability of lisinopril. Agents Increasing Serum Potassium Lisinopril attenuates potassium loss caused by thiazide-type diuretics. Use of lisinopril with potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., spironolactone, eplerenone, triamterene or amiloride), potassium supplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes may lead to significant increases in serum potassium. Therefore, if concomitant use of these agents is indicated because of demonstrated hypokalemia, they should be used with caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium. Potassium-sparing agents should generally not be used in patients with heart failure who are receiving lisinopril. Lithium Lithium toxicity has been reported in patients receiving lithium concomitantly with drugs which cause elimination of sodium, including ACE inhibitors. Lithium toxicity was usually reversible upon discontinuation of lithium and the ACE inhibitor. It is recommended that serum lithium levels be monitored frequently if lisinopril is administered concomitantly with lithium. Gold Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including lisinopril. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility There was no evidence of a tumorigenic effect when lisinopril was administered for 105 weeks to male and female rats at doses up to 90 mg/kg/day (about 56 or 9 times* the maximum recommended daily human dose, based on body weight and body surface area, respectively). There was no evidence of carcinogenicity when lisinopril was administered for 92 weeks to (male and female) mice at doses up to 135 mg/kg/day (about 84 times* the maximum recommended daily human dose). This dose was 6.8 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area in mice. Lisinopril was not mutagenic in the Ames microbial mutagen test with or without metabolic activation. It was also negative in a forward mutation assay using Chinese hamster lung cells. Lisinopril did not produce single strand DNA breaks in an in vitro alkaline elution rat hepatocyte assay. In addition, lisinopril did not produce increases in chromosomal aberrations in an in vitro test in Chinese hamster ovary cells or in an in vivo study in mouse bone marrow. There were no adverse effects on reproductive performance in male and female rats treated with up to 300 mg/kg/day of lisinopril. This dose is 188 times and 30 times the maximum human dose when based on mg/kg and mg/m2, respectively. *Calculations assume a human weight of 50 kg and human body surface area of 1.62 m2. Nursing Mothers Milk of lactating rats contains radioactivity following administration of 14C lisinopril. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from ACE inhibitors, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue lisinopril, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Neonates with a history of in utero exposure to lisinopril: If oliguria or hypotension occurs, direct attention toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function. Lisinopril, which crosses the placenta, has been removed from neonatal circulation by peritoneal dialysis with some clinical benefit, and theoretically may be removed by exchange transfusion, although there is no experience with the latter procedure. Antihypertensive effects of lisinopril have been established in hypertensive pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years. There are no data on the effect of lisinopril on blood pressure in pediatric patients under the age of 6 or in pediatric patients with glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics and Metabolismand Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects,and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of lisinopril in patients with hypertension did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other clinical experience in this population has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. In the ATLAS trial of lisinopril in patients with congestive heart failure, 1,596 (50%) were 65 and over, while 437 (14%) were 75 and over. In a clinical study of lisinopril in patients with myocardial infarctions, 4,413 (47%) were 65 and over, while 1,656 (18%) were 75 and over. In these studies, no overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients, and other reported clinical experiences have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects, Heart Failure and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects, Acute Myocardial Infarction). Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Pharmacokinetic studies indicate that maximum blood levels and area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) are doubled in older patients (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism). This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection. Evaluation of patients with hypertension, congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction should always include assessment of renal function (see"

        "DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION Hypertension Initial Therapy In patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension not on diuretic therapy, the recommended initial dose is 10 mg once a day. Dosage should be adjusted according to blood pressure response. The usual dosage range is 20 to 40 mg per day administered in a single daily dose. The antihypertensive effect may diminish toward the end of the dosing interval regardless of the administered dose, but most commonly with a dose of 10 mg daily. This can be evaluated by measuring blood pressure just prior to dosing to determine whether satisfactory control is being maintained for 24 hours. If it is not, an increase in dose should be considered. Doses up to 80 mg have been used but do not appear to give greater effect. If blood pressure is not controlled with lisinopril tablets USP alone, a low dose of a diuretic may be added. Hydrochlorothiazide, 12.5 mg has been shown to provide an additive effect. After the addition of a diuretic, it may be possible to reduce the dose of lisinopril tablets USP. Diuretic Treated Patients In hypertensive patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic hypotension may occur occasionally following the initial dose of lisinopril tablets USP. The diuretic should be discontinued, if possible, for two to three days before beginning therapy with lisinopril tablets USP to reduce the likelihood of hypotension (see WARNINGS). The dosage of lisinopril tablets USP should be adjusted according to blood pressure response. If the patientblood pressure is not controlled with lisinopril tablets USP alone, diuretic therapy may be resumed as described above. If the diuretic cannot be discontinued, an initial dose of 5 mg should be used under medical supervision for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour (see WARNINGSand PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). Concomitant administration of lisinopril tablets USP with potassium supplements, potassium salt substitutes, or potassium-sparing diuretics may lead to increases of serum potassium (see PRECAUTIONS). Dosage Adjustment in Renal Impairment The usual dose of lisinopril tablets USP (10 mg) is recommended for patients with creatinine clearance > 30 mL/min (serum creatinine of up to approximately 3 mg/dL). For patients with creatinine clearance10 mL/min30 mL/min (serum creatinine3 mg/dL), the first dose is 5 mg once daily. For patients with creatinine clearance < 10 mL/min (usually on hemodialysis) the recommended initial dose is 2.5 mg. The dosage may be titrated upward until blood pressure is controlled or to a maximum of 40 mg daily. * *See WARNINGS, Anaphylactoid ReactionsDuring Membrane Exposure. **Dosage or dosing interval should be adjusted depending on the blood pressure response.Renal StatusCreatinine Clearance mL/minInitial Dose mg/dayNormal renal function to mild impairment> 3010Moderate to severe impairment10305Dialysis patients* * < 102.5 ** Heart Failure Lisinopril tablets USP are indicated as adjunctive therapy with diuretics and (usually) digitalis. The recommended starting dose is 5 mg once a day. When initiating treatment with lisinopril, USP in patients with heart failure, the initial dose should be administered under medical observation, especially in those patients with low blood pressure (systolic blood pressure below 100 mmHg). The mean peak blood pressure lowering occurs six to eight hours after dosing. Observation should continue until blood pressure is stable. The concomitant diuretic dose should be reduced, if possible, to help minimize hypovolemia which may contribute to hypotension (see WARNINGSand PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). The appearance of hypotension after the initial dose of lisinopril tablets USP does not preclude subsequent careful dose titration with the drug, following effective management of the hypotension. The usual effective dosage range is 5 to 40 mg per day administered as a single daily dose. The dose of lisinopril tablets USP can be increased by increments of no greater than 10 mg, at intervals of no less than 2 weeks to the highest tolerated dose, up to a maximum of 40 mg daily. Dose adjustment should be based on the clinical response of individual patients. Dosage Adjustment in Patients With Heart Failure and Renal Impairment or Hyponatremia In patients with heart failure who have hyponatremia (serum sodium < 130 mEq/L) or moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance30 mL/min or serum creatinine > 3 mg/dL), therapy with lisinopril tablets USP should be initiated at a dose of 2.5 mg once a day under close medical supervision (see WARNINGSand PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). Acute Myocardial Infarction In hemodynamically stable patients within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms of acute myocardial infarction, the first dose of lisinopril tablets USP is 5 mg given orally, followed by 5 mg after 24 hours, 10 mg after 48 hours and then 10 mg of lisinopril tablets USP once daily. Dosing should continue for six weeks. Patients should receive, as appropriate, the standard recommended treatments such as thrombolytics, aspirin, and beta-blockers. Patients with a low systolic blood pressure (120 mmHg) when treatment is started or during the first 3 days after the infarct should be given a lower 2.5 mg oral dose of lisinopril tablets USP (see WARNINGS). If hypotension occurs (systolic blood pressure100 mmHg), a daily maintenance dose of 5 mg may be given with temporary reductions to 2.5 mg if needed. If prolonged hypotension occurs (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg for more than 1 hour) lisinopril tablets USP should be withdrawn. For patients who develop symptoms of heart failure, see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Heart Failure. Dosage Adjustment in Patients With Myocardial Infarction With Renal Impairment In acute myocardial infarction, treatment with lisinopril tablets USP should be initiated with caution in patients with evidence of renal dysfunction, defined as serum creatinine concentration exceeding 2 mg/dL. No evaluation of dosing adjustments in myocardial infarction patients with severe renal impairment has been performed. Use in Elderly In general, the clinical response was similar in younger and older patients given similar doses of lisinopril tablets USP. Pharmacokinetic studies, however, indicate that maximum blood levels and area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) are doubled in older patients, so that dosage adjustments should be made with particular caution. Pediatric Hypertensive Patients6 Years of Age The usual recommended starting dose is 0.07 mg/kg once daily (up to 5 mg total). Dosage should be adjusted according to blood pressure response. Doses above 0.61 mg/kg (or in excess of 40 mg) have not been studied in pediatric patients (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, PharmacokineticsandMetabolism and Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects). Lisinopril tablets USP are not recommended in pediatric patients < 6 years or in pediatric patients with glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism and Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects and PRECAUTIONS). Preparation of Suspension (for 200 mL of a 1 mg/mL Suspension) Add 10 mL of Purified Water USP to a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottle containing ten 20 mg tablets of lisinopril tablets USP and shake for at least one minute. Add 30 mL of Bicitradiluent and 160 mL of Ora-Sweet SFto the concentrate in the PET bottle and gently shake for several seconds to disperse the ingredients. The suspension should be stored at or below 25(77and can be stored for up to four weeks. Shake the suspension before each use."

Patients treated with lisinopril had a significantly higher incidence of hypotension and renal dysfunction compared with patients not taking lisinopril. In the GISSI-3 trial, hypotension (9.7%), renal dysfunction (2%), cough (0.5%), post infarction angina (0.3%), skin rash and generalized edema (0.01%), and angioedema (0.01%) resulted in withdrawal of treatment. In elderly patients treated with lisinopril, discontinuation due to renal dysfunction was 4.2%. Other clinical adverse experiences occurring in 0.3% to 1% of patients with hypertension or heart failure treated with lisinopril in controlled clinical trials and rarer, serious, possibly drug-related events reported in uncontrolled studies or marketing experience are listed below, and within each category, are in order of decreasing severity: Body as a Whole Anaphylactoid reactions (see WARNINGS, Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions), syncope, orthostatic effects, chest discomfort, pain, pelvic pain, flank pain, edema, facial edema, virus infection, fever, chills, malaise Cardiovascular Cardiac arrest; myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident, possibly secondary to excessive hypotension in high-risk patients (see WARNINGS, Hypotension); pulmonary embolsim and infarction, arrhythmias (including ventricular tachycardia, atrial tachycardia, atrial fibillation, bradycardia and premature ventricular contractions), palpitations, transient ischemic attacks, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthostatic hypotension, decreased blood pressure, peripheral edema, vasculitis Digestive Pancreatitis, hepatitis (hepatocellular or cholestatic jaundice) (see WARNINGS, Hepatic Failure), vomiting, gastritis, dyspepsia, heartburn, gastrointestinal cramps, constipation, flatulence, dry mouth Hematologic Rare cases of bone marrow depression, hemolytic anemia, leukopenia/neutropenia and thrombocytopenia Endocrine Diabetes mellitus, inappropriate antidiurectic hormone secretion Metabolic Weight loss, dehydration, fluid overload, gout, weight gain Cases of hypoglycemia in diabetic patients on oral antidiabetic agents or insulin have been reported in postmarketing experience (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).

Rash, photosensitivity or other dermatological manifestations may occur alone or in combination with these symptoms. Angioedema Angioedema has been reported in patients receiving lisinopril with an incidence higher in Black than in non-Black patients. Angioedema associated with laryngeal edema may be fatal. If angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis and/or larynx occurs, treatment with lisinopril should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted immediately (see WARNINGS). In rare cases, intestinal angioedema has been reported in postmarketing experience. Hypotension In hypertensive patients, hypotension occurred in 1.2% and syncope occurred in 0.1% of patients with an incidence higher in Black than in non-Black patients. Hypotension or syncope was a cause of discontinuation of therapy in 0.5% of hypertensive patients. In patients with heart failure, hypotension occurred in 5.3% and syncope occurred in 1.8% of patients. These adverse experiences were possibly dose-related (see above data from ATLAS Trial) and caused discontinuation of therapy in 1.8% of these patients in the symptomatic trials. In patients treated with lisinopril for six weeks after acute myocardial infarction, hypotension (systolic blood pressure100 mmHg) resulted in discontinuation of therapy in 9.7% of the patients (see WARNINGS). Cough PRECAUTIONS, Cough. Pediatric Patients No relevant differences between the adverse experience profile for pediatric patients and that previously reported for adult patients were identified. Clinical Laboratory Test Findings Serum Electrolytes Hyperkalemia (see PRECAUTIONS), hyponatremia p> Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, reversible upon discontinuation of therapy, were observed in about 2% of patients with essential hypertension treated with lisinopril alone. Increases were more common in patients receiving concomitant diuretics and in patients with renal artery stenosis (see PRECAUTIONS). Reversible minor increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine were observed in approximately 11.6% of patients with heart failure on concomitant diuretic therapy. Frequently, these abnormalities resolved when the dosage of the diuretic was decreased. Hemoglobin and Hematocrit Small decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit (mean decreases of approximately 0.4 G% and 1.3 vol%, respectively) occured frequently in patients treated with lisinopril but were rarely of clinical importance in patients without some other cause of anemia. In clinical trials, less than 0.1% of patients discontinued therapy due to anemia. Hemolytic anemia has been reported; a casual relationship to lisinopril cannot be excluded. Liver Function Tests Rarely, elevations of liver enzymes and/or serum bilirubin have occurred (see WARNINGS, Hepatic Failure). In hypertensive patients, 2% discontinued therapy due to laboratory adverse experiences, principally elevations in blood urea nitrogen (0.6%), serum creatinine (0.5%) and serum potassium (0.4%). In the heart faulure trials, 3.4% of patiens discontinued therapy due to laboratory adverse experience; 1.8% due to elevations in blood ura nitrogen and/or creatinine and 0.6 due to elevations in serum potassium. In the myocardial infarction trial, 2% of patients receiving lisinopril discontinued thereapy due to renal dysfunction (increasing creatinine concentration to over 3 mg/dL or a doubling or more of the baseline serum creatinine concentration); less than 1% of patients discontinued therapy due to other laboratory adverse experiences: 0.1% with hyperkalemia and less than 0.1% with hepatic enzyme alterations."

        "INDICATIONS & USAGE Hypertension Lisinopril tablets USP are indicated for the treatment of hypertension to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including lisinopril. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education ProgramJoint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in Black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Lisinopril tablets USP may be administered alone or with other antihypertensive agents Heart Failure Lisinopril tablets USP are indicated as adjunctive therapy in the management of heart failure in patients who are not responding adequately to diuretics and digitalis. Acute Myocardial Infarction Lisinopril tablets USP are indicated for the treatment of hemodynamically stable patients within 24 hours of acute myocardial infarction, to improve survival. Patients should receive, as appropriate, the standard recommended treatments such as thrombolytics, aspirin and beta-blockers. In using lisinopril tablets USP, consideration should be given to the fact that another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen vascular disease, and that available data are insufficient to show that lisinopril tablets USP do not have a similar risk (see WARNINGS). In considering the use of lisinopril tablets USP, it should be noted that in controlled clinical trials, ACE inhibitors have an effect on blood pressure that is less in Black patients than in non-Blacks. In addition, ACE inhibitors have been associated with a higher rate of angioedema in Black than in non-Black patients (see WARNINGS, Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions)."

      "clinical_pharmacology": [
        "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Lisinopril inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in human subjects and animals. ACE is a peptidly dispeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotension I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotension II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. The beneficial effects of lisinopril in hypertension and heart failure appear to result primarily from suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter decrease may result in a small increase of serum potassum. In hypertensive patiens with normal renal function treated with lisinopril alone for up to 24 weeks, the mean increase in serum potassium was approximately 0.1 mEq/L; however, approximately 15% of patients had increases greater than 0.5 mEq/L and approximately 6% had a decrease greater than 0.5 mEq/L and approximately 12% had a decrease greater than 0.5 mEq/L (see PRECAUTIONS). Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity. ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of lisinopril remains to be elucidated. While the mechanism through which lisinopril lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system,lisinopril is antihypertensive even in patients with low-renin hypertension. Although lisinopril was antihypertensive in all races studied, Black hypertensive patients (usually a low-renin hypertensive population) had a smaller average response to monotherapy than non-Black patients. Concomitant administration of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide further reduced blood pressure in Black and non-Black patients and any racial differences in blood pressure response were no longer evident. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Adult Patients Following oral administration of lisinopril, peak serum concentrations of lisinopril occur within about 7 hours, although there was a trend to a small delay in time taken to reach peak serum concentrations in acute myocardial infarction patients. Declining serum concentrations exhibit a prolonged terminal phase which does not contribute to drug accumulation. This terminal phase probably represents saturable binding to ACE and is not proportional to dose. Lisinopril does not appear to be bound to other serum proteins. Lisinopril does not undergo metabolism and is excreted unchanged entirely in the urine. Based on urinary recovery, the mean extent of absorption of lisinopril is approximately 25%, with large intersubject variability (6 to 60%) at all doses tested (5 to 80 mg). Lisinopril absorption is not influenced by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract. The absolute bioavailability of lisinopril is reduced to 16% in patients with stable NYHA Class II-IV congestive heart failure, and the volume of distribution appears to be slightly smaller than that in normal subjects. The oral bioavailability of lisinopril in patients with acute myocardial infarction is similar to that in healthy volunteers. Upon multiple dosing, lisinopril exhibits an effective half-life of accumulation of 12 hours. Impaired renal function decreases elimination of lisinopril, which is excreted principally through the kidneys, but this decrease becomes clinically important only when the glomerular filtration rate is below 30 mL/min. Above this glomerular filtration rate, the elimination half-life is little changed. With greater impairment, however, peak and trough lisinopril levels increase, time to peak concentration increases and time to attain steady state is prolonged. Older patients, on average, have (approximately doubled) higher blood levels and area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) than younger patients (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Lisinopril can be removed by hemodialysis. Studies in rats indicate that lisinopril crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly. Multiple doses of lisinopril in rats do not result in accumulation in any tissues. Milk of lactating rats contains radioactivity following administration of 14C lisinopril. By whole body autoradiography, radioactivity was found in the placenta following administration of labeled drug to pregnant rats, but none was found in the fetuses. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of lisinopril were studied in 29 pediatric hypertensive patients between 6 years and 16 years with glomerular filtration rate > 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. After doses of 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg, steady state peak plasma concentrations of lisinopril occurred within 6 hours and the extent of absorption based on urinary recovery was about 28%. These values are similar to those obtained previously in adults. The typical value of lisinopril oral clearance (systemic clearance/absolute bioavailability) in a child weighing 30 kg is 10 L/h, which increases in proportion to renal function. Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects Hypertension Adult Patients Administration of lisinopril to patients with hypertension results in a reduction of both supine and standing blood pressure to about the same extent with no compensatory tachycardia. Symptomatic postural hypotension is usually not observed although it can occur and should be anticipated in volume and/or salt-depleted patients (see WARNINGS). When given together with thiazide-type diuretics, the blood pressure lowering effects of the two drugs are approximately additive. In most patients studied, onset of antihypertensive activity was seen at one hour after oral administration of an individual dose of lisinopril, with peak reduction of blood pressure achieved by 6 hours. Although an antihypertensive effect was observed 24 hours after dosing with recommended single daily doses, the effect was more consistent and the mean effect was considerably larger in some studies with doses of 20 mg or more than with lower doses. However, at all doses studied, the mean antihypertensive effect was substantially smaller 24 hours after dosing than it was 6 hours after dosing. In some patients, achievement of optimal blood pressure reduction may require two to four weeks of therapy. The antihypertensive effects of lisinopril are maintained during long-term therapy. Abrupt withdrawal of lisinopril has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure, or a significant increase in blood pressure compared to pretreatment levels. Lisinopril had similar effectiveness and adverse effects in younger and older (> 65 years) patients. It was less effective in Blacks than in Caucasians. In hemodynamic studies in patients with essential hypertension, blood pressure reduction was accompanied by a reduction in peripheral arterial resistance with little or no change in cardiac output and in heart rate. In a study in nine hypertensive patients, following administration of lisinopril, there was an increase in mean renal blood flow that was not significant. Data from several small studies are inconsistent with respect to the effect of lisinopril on glomerular filtration rate in hypertensive patients with normal renal function, but suggest that changes, if any, are not large. In patients with renovascular hypertension lisinopril has been shown to be well tolerated and effective in controlling blood pressure (see PRECAUTIONS). Pediatric Patients In a clinical study involving 115 hypertensive pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age, patients who weighed < 50 kg received either 0.625, 2.5, or 20 mg of lisinopril daily and patients who weighed50 kg received either 1.25, 5, or 40 mg of lisinopril daily. At the end of 2 weeks, lisinopril administered once daily lowered trough blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner with consistent antihypertensive efficacy demonstrated at doses > 1.25 mg (0.02 mg/kg). This effect was confirmed in a withdrawal phase, where the diastolic pressure rose by about 9 mmHg more in patients randomized to placebo than it did in patients who were randomized to remain on the middle and high doses of lisinopril. The dose-dependent antihypertensive effect of lisinopril was consistent across several demographic subgroups: age, Tanner stage, gender, and race. In this study, lisinopril was generally well-tolerated. In the above pediatric studies, lisinopril was given either as tablets or in a suspension for those children and infants who were unable to swallow tablets or who required a lower dose than is available in tablet form (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Preparation of Suspension (for 200 mL of a 1 mg/mL Suspension)). Heart Failure During baseline-controlled clinical trials, in patients receiving digitalis and diuretics, single doses of lisinopril resulted in decreases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure accompanied by an increase in cardiac output and no change in heart rate. In two placebo controlled, 12 week clinical studies using doses of lisinopril up to 20 mg, lisinopril as adjunctive therapy to digitalis and diuretics improved the following signs and symptoms due to congestive heart failure: edema, rales, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and jugular venous distention. In one of the studies, beneficial response was also noted for: orthopnea, presence of third heart sound and the number of patients classified as NYHA Class III and IV. Exercise tolerance was also improved in this study. The once-daily dosing for the treatment of congestive heart failure was the only dosage regimen used during clinical trial development and was determined by the measurement of hemodynamic response. A large (over 3000 patients) survival study, the ATLAS Trial, comparing 2.5 and 35 mg of lisinopril in patients with heart failure, showed that the higher dose of lisinopril had outcomes at least as favorable as the lower dose.< Acute Myocardial Infarction The Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvienza nellMiocardico (GISSI-3) study was a multicenter, controlled, randomized, unblinded clinical trial conducted in 19,394 patients with acute myocardial infarction admitted to a coronary care unit. It was designed to examine the effects of short-term (6 week) treatment with lisinopril, nitrates, their combination, or no therapy on short-term (6 week) mortality and on long-term death and markedly impaired cardiac function. Patients presenting within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms who were hemodynamically stable were randomized, in a 2 x 2 factorial design, to six weeks of either 1) lisinopril alone (n = 4841), 2) nitrates alone (n = 4869), 3) lisinopril plus nitrates (n = 4841), or 4) open control (n = 4843). All patients received routine therapies, including thrombolytics (72%), aspirin (84%), and a beta-blocker (31%), as appropriate, normally utilized in acute myocardial infarction (MI) patients. The protocol excluded patients with hypotension (systolic blood pressure100 mmHg), severe heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and renal dysfunction (serum creatinine > 2 mg/dL and/or proteinuria > 500 mg/24 h). Doses of lisinopril were adjusted as necessary according to protocol (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Study treatment was withdrawn at six weeks except where clinical conditions indicated continuation of treatment. The primary outcomes of the trial were the overall mortality at 6 weeks and a combined endpoint at 6 months after the myocardial infarction, consisting of the number of patients who died, had late (day 4) clinical congestive heart failure, or had extensive left ventricular damage defined as ejection fraction35% or an akinetic-dyskinetic [A-D] score45%. Patients receiving lisinopril (n = 9646), alone or with nitrates, had an 11% lower risk of death (2p [two-tailed] = 0.04) compared to patients receiving no lisinopril (n = 9672) (6.4% vs. 7.2%, respectively) at six weeks. Although patients randomized to receive lisinopril for up to six weeks also fared numerically better on the combined endpoint at 6 months, the open nature of the assessment of heart failure, substantial loss to follow-up echocardiography, and substantial excess use of lisinopril between 6 weeks and 6 months in the group randomized to 6 weeks of lisinopril, preclude any conclusion about this endpoint. Patients with acute myocardial infarction, treated with lisinopril, had a higher (9% vs. 3.7%) incidence of persistent hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg for more than 1 hour) and renal dysfunction (2.4% vs. 1.1%) in-hospital and at six weeks (increasing creatinine concentration to over 3 mg/dL or a doubling or more of the baseline serum creatinine concentration) (see ADVERSE REACTIONS , Acute Myocardial Infarction)."

        "PRECAUTIONS GENERAL: Epinephrine 1:1000 should be available as well as personnel trained in administering emergency treatment. Allergenic Extracts are not intended for intravenous injections. For safe and effective use of allergenic extracts, sterile diluents, sterile vials, sterile syringes should be used and aseptic precautions observed when making a dilution and/or administering the allergenic extract injection. A sterile tuberculin syringe graduated in 0.1 ml units to measure each dose for the prescribed dilution should be used. To reduce the risk of an occurrence of adverse reactions, begin with a careful personal history plus a physical exam. Confirm your findings with scratch or intradermal skin testing. Standardized extracts are those labeled in AU/ml units or BAU/ml units. Standardized extracts are not interchangeable with extracts previously labeled as wt/vol or PNU/ml. Before administering a standardized extract, read the accompanying insert contained with standardized extracts. Information for Patients: All concentrates of allergenic extracts have the ability to cause serious local and systemic reactions including death in sensitive patients. Patients should be informed of this risk prior to skin testing and immunotherapy. Patients should be instructed to recognize adverse reaction symptoms that may occur and to report all adverse reactions to a physician. Patients should be instructed to remain in the office for 30 minutes during testing using allergenic extracts and at least 30 minutes after therapeutic injections using allergenic extracts. DRUG INTERACTIONS: Some drugs may affect the reactivity of the skin; patients should be instructed to avoid medications, particularly antihistamines and sympathomimetic drugs, for at least 24 hours prior to skin testing. Antihistamines and Hydroxyzine can significantly inhibit the immediate skin test reactions as they tend to neutralize or antagonize the action of histamine. (3) This effect has been primarily documented when testing was performed within 1 to 2 hours after drug ingestion. Partial inhibition of the skin test reaction had been observed for longer periods. Epinephrine injection inhibits the immediate skin test reactions for several hours. Patients on delayed absorption antihistamine tablets should be free of such medication for 48 hours before testing. Patients using Astemizole (Hismanal) may experience prolonged suppression and should be free from such medication for up to 6 to 8 weeks prior to testing. Refer to package insert from an applicable long acting antihistamine manufacturer for additional information. Extreme caution should be taken when using allergenic extracts on patients who are taking beta-blockers. Patients on non-selective beta blockers may be more reactive to allergens given for testing or treatment and may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions. Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility: Long term studies in animals have not been conducted with allergenic extracts to determine their potential carcinogenicity, mutagenicity or impairment of fertility. Pregnancy: Category C: Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Allergenic Extracts. It is not known whether allergenic extracts can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women or can affect reproduction capacity. Allergenic extracts should be given to pregnant women only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug appears in human milk. Because many drugs are detected in human milk, caution should be exercised when Allergenic Extracts are administered to a nursing woman. There are no current studies on extract components in human milk, or their effect on the nursing infant. Pediatric Use: Allergenic extracts have been used in children over two years of age. (5)"

        "WARNINGS DO NOT INJECT INTRAVENOUSLY. Epinephrine 1:1000 should be available. Concentrated extracts must be diluted with sterile diluent prior to first use on a patient for treatment or intradermal testing. All concentrates of glycerinated allergenic extracts have the ability to cause serious local and systemic reactions including death in sensitive patients. Sensitive patients may experience severe anaphylactic reactions resulting in respiratory obstruction, shock, coma and /or death. (4) (See Adverse Reactions) An allergenic extract should be temporarily withheld from patients or the dose of the extract adjusted downward if any of the following conditions exist: (1) Severe symptoms of rhinitis and/or asthma (2) Infections or flu accompanied by fever and (3) Exposure to excessive amounts of clinically relevant allergen prior to a scheduled injection. When switching patients to a new lot of the same extract the initial dose should be reduced 3/4 so that 25% of previous dose is administered."

        "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION General Precautions Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permits. The dosage of allergenic extracts is dependent upon the purpose of the administration. Allergenic extracts can be administered for diagnostic use or for therapeutic use. When allergenic extracts are administered for diagnostic use, the dosage is dependent upon the method used. Two methods commonly used are scratch testing and intradermal testing. Both types of tests result in a wheal and flare response at the site of the test which usually develops rapidly and may be read in 20-30 minutes. Diagnostic Use : Scratch Testing Method Scratch testing is considered a simple and safe method although less sensitive than the intradermal test. Scratch testing can be used to determine the degree of sensitivity to a suspected allergen before using the intradermal test. This combination lessens the severity of response to an allergen which can occur in a very sensitive patient. The most satisfactory testing site is the patient's back or volar surface of the arms from the axilla to 2.5 or 5cm above the wrist, skipping the anti-cubital space. If using the back as a testing site, the most satisfactory area are from the posterior axillary fold to 2.5 cm from the spinal column, and from the top of the scapula to the lower rib margins. Allergenic extracts for diagnostic use are to be administered in the following manner: To scratch surface of skin, use a circular scarifier. Do not draw blood. Tests sites should be 4 cm apart to allow for wheal and flare reaction. 1-30 scratch tests may be done at a time. A separate sterile scratch instrument is to be used on each patient to prevent transmission of homologous serum hepatitis or other infectious agents from one patient to another. The recommended usual dosage for Scratch testing is one drop of allergen applied to each scratch site. Do not let dropper touch skin. Always apply a control scratch with each test set. Sterile Diluent (for a negative control) is used in exactly the same way as an active test extract. Histamine may be used as a positive control. Scratch or prick test sites should be examined at 15 and 30 minutes. To prevent excessive absorption, wipe off antigens producing large reactions as soon as the wheal appears. Record the size of the reaction. Interpretation of Scratch Test Skin tests are graded in terms of the wheal and erythema response noted at 10 to 20 minutes. Wheal and erythema size may be recorded by actual measurement as compared with positive and negative controls. A positive reaction consists of an area of erythema surrounding the scarification that is larger than the control site. For uniformity in reporting reactions, the following system is recommended. (6) REACTION SYMBOL CRITERIA Negative - No wheal. Erythema absent or very slight (not more than 1 mm diameter) . One Plus + Wheal absent or very slight erythema present (not more than 3 mm diameter) . Two Plus ++ Wheal not more than 3mm or erythema not more than 5mm diameter. Three Plus +++ Wheal between 3mm and 5mm diameter, with erythema. Possible pseudopodia and itching. Four Plus ++++ A larger reaction with itching and pain. Diagnostic Use: Intradermal Skin Testing Method Do not perform intradermal test with allergens which have evoked a 2+ or greater response to a Scratch test. Clean test area with alcohol, place sites 5 cm apart using separate sterile tuberculin syringe and a 25 gauge needle for each allergen. Insert needle tip, bevel up, into intracutaneous space. Avoid injecting into blood vessel, pull back gently on syringe plunger, if blood enters syringe change position of needle. The recommended dosage and range for intradermal testing is 0.05 ml of not more than 100 pnu/ml or 1:1000 w/v (only if puncture test is negative) of allergenic extract. Inject slowly until a small bleb is raised. It is important to make each bleb the same size. Interpretation of Intradermal Test: The patient's reaction is graded on the basis of size of wheal and flare as compared to control. Use 0.05 ml sterile diluent as a negative control to give accurate interpretation. The tests may be accurately interpreted only when the saline control site has shown a negative response. Observe patient for at least 30 minutes. Tests can be read in 15-20 minutes. Edema, erythema and presence of pseudopods, pain and itching may be observed in 4 plus reactions. For uniformity in reporting reactions the following system is recommended. (6) REACTION SYMBOL CRITERIA Negative - No increase in size of bleb since injection. No erythema. One Plus + An increase in size of bleb to a wheal not more than 5mm diameter, with associated erythema. Two Plus ++ Wheal between 5mm and 8mm diameter with erythema. Three Plus +++ Wheal between 8mm and 12mm diameter with erythema and possible pseudopodia and itching or pain. Four Plus ++++ Any larger reaction with itch and pain, and possible diffuse blush of the skin surrounding the reaction area. Therapeutic Use: Recommended dosage & range Check the listed ingredients to verify that it matches the prescription ordered. When using a prescription set, verify the patient's name and the ingredients listed with the prescription order. Assess the patient's physical and emotional status prior to giving as injection. Do not give injections to patients who are in acute distress. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Dosage of allergenic extracts is a highly individualized matter and varies according to the degree of sensitivity of the patient, his clinical response and tolerance to the extract administered during the early phases of an injection regimen. The dosage must be reduced when transferring a patient from non-standardized or modified extract to standardized extract. Any evidence of a local or generalized reaction requires a reduction in dosage during the initial stages of immunotherapy as well as during maintenance therapy. After therapeutic injections patients should be observed for at least 20 minutes for reaction symptoms. SUGGESTED DOSAGE SCHEDULE The following schedule may act as a guide. This schedule has not been proven to be safe or effective. Sensitive patients may begin with smaller doses of weaker solutions and the dosage increments can be less. STRENGTH DOSE VOLUME Vial #1 1 0.05 1:100,000 w/v 2 0.10 10 pnu/ml 3 0.15 1 AU/ml 4 0.20 1 BAU/ml 5 0.30 6 0.40 7 0.50 Vial #2 8 0.05 1:10,000 w/v 9 0.10 100 pnu/ml 10 0.15 10 AU/ml 11 0.20 10 BAU/ml 12 0.30 13 0.40 14 0.50 Vial #3 15 0.05 1:1,000 w/v 16 0.10 1,000 pnu/ml 17 0.15 100 AU/ml 18 0.20 100 BAU/ml 19 0.30 20 0.40 21 0.50 Vial #4 22 0.05 1:100 w/v 23 0.07 10,000 pnu/ml 24 0.10 1,000 AU/ml 25 0.15 1,000 BAU/ml 26 0.20 27 0.25 Maintenance Refill 28 0.25 1:100 w/v 29 0.25 10,000 pnu/ml 30 0.25 1,000 AU/ml 31 0.25 1,000 BAU/ml 32 0.25 subsequent doses 33 0.25 Preparation Instructions: All dilutions may be made using sterile buffered diluent. The calculation may be based on the following ratio: Volume desired x Concentration desired = Volume needed x Concentration available. Example 1 : If a 1:10 w/v extract is available and it is desired to use a 1:1,000 w/v extract substitute as follows: Vd x Cd = Vn x Ca 10ml x 0.001 = Vn x 0.1 0.1 ml = Vn Using a sterile technique, remove 0.10 ml of extract from the 1:10 vial and place it into a vial containing 9.90 ml of sterile diluent. The resulting ratio will be a 10 ml vial of 1:1,000 w/v. Example 2 : If a 10,000 pnu/ml extract is available and it is desired to use a 100 pnu/ml extract substitute as follows: 10ml x 100 = Vn x 10,000 0.1 ml = Vn Using a sterile technique, remove 0.10 ml of extract from the 10,000 pnu/ml vial and place it into a vial containing 9.90 ml of sterile diluent. The resulting concentration will be a 10 ml vial of 100 pnu/ml. Example 3: If a 10,000 AU/ml or BAU/ml extract is available and it is desired to use a 100 AU/ml or BAU/ml extract substitute as follows: Vd x Cd = Vn x Ca 10ml x 100 = Vn x 10,000 0.1 ml = Vn Using a sterile technique, remove 0.10 ml of extract from the 10,000 AU/ml or BAU/ml vial and place it into a vial containing 9.90 ml of sterile diluent. The resulting concentration will be 10ml vial of 100 AU/ml or BAU/ml. Intervals between doses: The optimal interval between doses of allergenic extract has not been definitely established. The amount of allergenic extract is increased at each injection by not more than 50%-100% of the previous amount and the next increment is governed by the response to the last injection. There are three generally accepted methods of pollen hyposensitizing therapy. 1. PRESEASONAL Treatment starts each year 6 to 8 weeks before onset of seasonal symptoms. Maximal dose reached just before symptoms are expected. Injections discontinued during and following season until next year. 2. CO-SEASONAL Patient is first treated during season with symptoms. Low initial doses are employed to prevent worsening of condition. This is followed by an intensive schedule of therapy (i.e. injections given 2 to 3 times per week). Fewer Allergists are resorting to this Co-seasonal therapy because of the availability of more effective, symptomatic medications that allow the patient to go through a season relatively symptom free. 3. PERENNIAL Initially this is the same as pre seasonal. The allergen is administered twice weekly or weekly for about 20 injections to achieve the maximum tolerated dose. Then, maintenance therapy may be administered once a week or less frequently. Duration of Treatment: The usual duration of treatment has not been established. A period of two or three years of injection therapy constitutes an average minimum course of treatment."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse systemic reactions usually occur within minutes and consist primarily of allergic symptoms such as: generalized skin erythema, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, rhinitis, wheezing, laryngeal edema, itching of nose and throat, breathlessness, dyspnea, coughing, hypotension and marked perspiration. Less commonly, nausea, emesis, abdominal cramps, diarrhea and uterine contractions may occur. Severe reactions may cause anaphylaxis or shock and loss of consciousness and rarely death. The treatment of systemic allergic reactions is dependent upon the system complex. Antihistamines may offer relief of recurrent urticaria, associated skin reactions and gastrointestinal symptoms. Corticosteroids may provide benefit if symptoms are prolonged or recurrent. (See Overdose section) Local Reactions consisting of erythema, itching, swelling tenderness and sometimes pain may occur at the injection site. These reactions may appear within a few minutes to hours and persist for several days. Local cold applications and oral antihistamines may be effective treatment. For marked and prolonged local reactions the use of antihistamines or anti-inflammatory medications may be dictated. Serious adverse reactions should be reported to Nelco Laboratories immediately and a report can be filed to: MedWatch, The FDA Medical Product Problem Reporting Program, at 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20852-9787, call 1-800-FDA-1088."

Allergenic extracts are indicated for the treatment of allergen specific allergic disease for use as hyposensitization or immunotherapy when avoidance of specific allergens can not be attained. The use of allergenic extracts for therapeutic purpose has been established by well-controlled clinical studies. Allergenic extracts may be used as adjunctive therapy along with pharmacotherapy which includes antihistamines, corticosteroids, and cromoglycate, and avoidance measures. Allergenic extracts for therapeutic use should be given using only the allergen selection to which the patient is allergic, has a history of exposure and are likely to be exposed to again."

      "clinical_pharmacology": [
        "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The pharmacological action of allergenic extracts used diagnostically is based on the liberation of histamine and other substances when the allergen reacts with IgE antibodies attached to the mast cells. When allergenic extracts are used for immunotherapy, the effect is an increase in immunoglobulin G (IgG) and an increased T suppresser lymphocyte which interferes with the allergic response. (2) With repeated administration of allergenic extracts changes develop in regards to IgG and IgE production and mediator-releasing cells. The histamine release response is reduced in some patients."

      "overdosage": [
        "OVERDOSAGE Overdose can cause both local and systemic reactions. An overdose may be prevented by careful observation and questioning of the patient about the previous injection. If systemic or anaphylactic reaction, does occur, apply a tourniquet above the site of injection and inject intramuscularly or subcutaneously 0.3 to 0.5ml of 1:1000 Epinephrine Hydrochloride into the opposite arm. The dose may be repeated in 5-10 minutes if necessary. Loosen the tourniquet at least every 10 minutes. The Epinephrine Hydrochloride 1:1000 dose for infants to 2 years is 0.05 to 0.1 ml, for children 2 to 6 years it is 0.15 ml, for children 6-12 years it is 0.2 ml. Patients unresponsive to Epinephrine may be treated with Theophylline. Studies on asthmatic subjects reveal that plasma concentrations of Theophylline of 5 to 20 \u00b5g/ml are associated with therapeutic effects. Toxicity is particularly apparent at concentrations greater than 20 \u00b5g/ml. A loading dose of Aminophylline of 5.8 mg/kg intravenously followed by 0.9 mg/kg per hour results in plasma concentrations of approximately 10 \u00b5g/ml for patients not previously receiving theophylline. (Mitenko and Ogilive, Nicholoson and Chick,1973) Other beta-adrenergic drugs such as Isoproterenol, Isoetharine, or Albuterol may be used by inhalation. The usual dose to relieve broncho-constriction in asthma is 0.5 ml of the 0.5% solution for Isoproterenol HCl. The Albuterol inhaler delivers approximately 90 mcg of Albuterol from the mouthpiece. The usual dosage for adults and children would be two inhalations repeated every 4-6 hours. Isoetharine supplied in the Bronkometer unit delivers approximately 340 mcg Isoetharine. The average dose is one to two inhalations. Respiratory obstruction not responding to parenteral or inhaled bronchodilators may require oxygen, intubation and the use of life support systems."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 2 includes drugs with clinically important drug interactions when administered concomitantly with ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets and instructions for preventing or managing them. Consult the labeling of concomitantly used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with PPIs. Table 2: Clinically Relevant Interactions Affecting Drugs Co-Administered with ACIPHEX Delayed-Release Tablets Antiretrovirals Clinical Impact: The effect of PPI on antiretroviral drugs is variable. The clinical importance and the mechanisms behind these interactions are not always known. Decreased exposure of some antiretroviral drugs (e.g., rilpivirine, atazanavir, and nelfinavir) when used concomitantly with rabeprazole may reduce antiviral effect and promote the development of drug resistance. Increased exposure of other antiretroviral drugs (e.g., saquinavir) when used concomitantly with rabeprazole may increase toxicity . There are other antiretroviral drugs which do not result in clinically relevant interactions with rabeprazole. Intervention: Rilpivirine -containing products : Concomitant use with ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) ] . See prescribing information. Atazanavir : See prescribing information for atazanavir for dosing information. Nelfinavir : Avoid concomitant use with ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets. See prescribing information for nelfinavir. Saquinavir: See the prescribing information for saquinavir and monitor for potential saquinavir toxicities. Other antiretrovirals : See prescribing information. Warfarin Clinical Impact: Increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving PPIs, including rabeprazole, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Intervention: Monitor INR and prothrombin time. Dose adjustment of warfarin may be needed to maintain target INR range. See prescribing information for warfarin. Methotrexate Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of rabeprazole with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. No formal drug interaction studies of methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Intervention: A temporary withdrawal of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets may be considered in some patients receiving high dose methotrexate administration. Digoxin Clinical Impact: Potential for increased exposure of digoxin [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Intervention: Monitor digoxin concentrations. Dose adjustment of digoxin may be needed to maintain therapeutic drug concentrations. See prescribing information for digoxin. Drugs Dependent on Gastric pH for Absorption (e.g., ir on salts, erlotinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, mycophenol ate mofetil, ketoconazole , itraconazole ) Clinical Impact: Rabeprazole can reduce the absorption of drugs due to its effect on reducing intragastric acidity. Intervention: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF): Co-administration of PPIs in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving PPIs and MMF. Use ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets with caution in transplant patients receiving MMF. See the prescribing information for other drugs dependent on gastric pH for absorption. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin and Amoxicillin Clinical Impact: Concomitant administration of clarithromycin with other drugs can lead to serious adverse reactions, including potentially fatal arrhythmias, and are contraindicated . Amoxicillin also has drug interactions. Intervention: See Contraindications and Warnings and Precautions in prescribing information for clarithromycin. See Drug Interactions in prescribing information for amoxicillin. See full prescribing information for a list of clinically important drug interactions ( 7 )."

      "pharmacodynamics": [
        "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Antisecretory Activity The antisecretory effect begins within one hour after oral administration of 20 mg ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets. The median inhibitory effect of rabeprazole on 24 hour gastric acidity is 88% of maximal after the first dose. A 20 mg dose of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets inhibits basal and peptone meal-stimulated acid secretion versus placebo by 86% and 95%, respectively, and increases the percent of a 24-hour period that the gastric pH>3 from 10% to 65% ( see table below ). This relatively prolonged pharmacodynamic action compared to the short pharmacokinetic half-life (1 to 2 hours) reflects the sustained inactivation of the H + , K + ATPase. Table 3: Gastric Acid Parameters: ACIPHEX Delayed-Release Tablets versus Placebo After 7 Days of Once Daily Dosing Parameter ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets (20 mg once daily) Placebo Basal Acid Output (mmol/hr) 0.4* 2.8 Stimulated Acid Output (mmol/hr) 0.6* 13.3 % Time Gastric pH>3 65* 10 *(p<0.01 versus placebo) Compared to placebo, 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets, administered once daily for 7 days significantly decreased intragastric acidity with all doses for each of four meal-related intervals and the 24-hour time period overall. In this study, there were no statistically significant differences between doses; however, there was a significant dose-related decrease in intragastric acidity. The ability of rabeprazole to cause a dose-related decrease in mean intragastric acidity is illustrated below. Table 4: AUC Acidity (Mmol\u2022Hr/L): ACIPHEX Delayed-Release Tablets versus Placebo on Day 7 of Once Daily Dosing (Mean\u00b1SD) ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets Placebo (N=24) AUC interval (hrs) 10 mg (N=24) 20 mg (N=24) 40 mg (N=24) 08:00 \u2013 13:00 19.6\u00b121.5* 12.9\u00b123* 7.6\u00b114.7* 91.1\u00b139.7 13:00 \u2013 19:00 5.6\u00b19.7* 8.3\u00b129.8* 1.3\u00b15.2* 95.5\u00b148.7 19:00 \u2013 22:00 0.1\u00b10.1* 0.1\u00b10.06* 0.0\u00b10.02* 11.9\u00b112.5 22:00 \u2013 08:00 129.2\u00b184* 109.6\u00b167.2* 76.9\u00b158.4* 479.9\u00b1165 AUC 0-24 hours 155.5\u00b190.6* 130.9\u00b181* 85.8\u00b164.3* 678.5\u00b1216 *(p<0.001 versus placebo) After administration of 20 mg ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets once daily for eight days, the mean percent of time that gastric pH greater than 3 or gastric pH greater than 4 after a single dose (Day 1) and multiple doses (Day 8) was significantly greater than placebo ( see table below ). The decrease in gastric acidity and the increase in gastric pH observed with 20 mg ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets administered once daily for eight days were compared to the same parameters for placebo, as illustrated below: Table 5: Gastric Acid Parameters ACIPHEX Delayed-Release Tablets Once Daily Dosing versus Placebo on Day 1 and Day 8 Parameter ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets 20 mg once daily Placebo Day 1 Day 8 Day 1 Day 8 Mean AUC 0-24 Acidity 340.8* 176.9* 925.5 862.4 Median trough pH (23-hr) a 3.77 3.51 1.27 1.38 % Time Gastric pH greater than 3 b 54.6* 68.7* 19.1 21.7 % Time Gastric pH greater than 4 b 44.1* 60.3* 7.6 11.0 a No inferential statistics conducted for this parameter. b Gastric pH was measured every hour over a 24-hour period. * (p<0.001 versus placebo) Effects on Esophageal Acid Exposure In patients with GERD and moderate to severe esophageal acid exposure, a dose of 20 mg and 40 mg per day of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets decreased 24-hour esophageal acid exposure. After seven days of treatment, the percentage of time that the esophageal pH was less than 4 decreased from baselines of 24.7% for 20 mg and 23.7% for 40 mg, to 5.1% and 2.0%, respectively. Normalization of 24-hour intraesophageal acid exposure was correlated to gastric pH greater than 4 for at least 35% of the 24-hour period; this level was achieved in 90% of subjects receiving ACIPHEX 20 mg and in 100% of subjects receiving ACIPHEX 40 mg. With ACIPHEX 20 mg and 40 mg per day, significant effects on gastric and esophageal pH were noted after one day of treatment, and more pronounced after seven days of treatment. Effects on Serum Gastrin The median fasting gastrin level increased in a dose-related manner in patients treated once daily with ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets for up to eight weeks for ulcerative or erosive esophagitis and in patients treated for up to 52 weeks to prevent recurrence of disease. The group median values stayed within the normal range. In a group of subjects treated with 20 mg ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets for 4 weeks a doubling of mean serum gastrin concentrations was observed. Approximately 35% of these treated subjects developed serum gastrin concentrations above the upper limit of normal. Effects on Enterochromaffin-like (ECL) Cells Increased serum gastrin secondary to antisecretory agents stimulates proliferation of gastric ECL cells which, over time, may result in ECL cell hyperplasia in rats and mice and gastric carcinoids in rats, especially in females [ see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . In over 400 patients treated with ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets (10 or 20 mg) once daily for up to one year, the incidence of ECL cell hyperplasia increased with time and dose, which is consistent with the pharmacological action of the proton-pump inhibitor. No patient developed the adenomatoid, dysplastic or neoplastic changes of ECL cells in the gastric mucosa. No patient developed the carcinoid tumors observed in rats. Endocrine Effects Studies in humans for up to one year have not revealed clinically significant effects on the endocrine system. In healthy male subjects treated with ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets for 13 days, no clinically relevant changes have been detected in the following endocrine parameters examined: 17 \u03b2-estradiol, thyroid stimulating hormone, tri-iodothyronine, thyroxine, thyroxine-binding protein, parathyroid hormone, insulin, glucagon, renin, aldosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteotrophic hormone, prolactin, somatotrophic hormone, dehydroepiandrosterone, cortisol-binding globulin, and urinary 6\u03b2-hydroxycortisol, serum testosterone and circadian cortisol profile. Other Effects In humans treated with ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets for up to one year, no systemic effects have been observed on the central nervous, lymphoid, hematopoietic, renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, or respiratory systems. No data are available on long-term treatment with ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets and ocular effects."

        "11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets is rabeprazole sodium, which is a proton pump inhibitor. It is a substituted benzimidazole known chemically as 2-[[[4-(3-methoxypropoxy)-3-methyl-2-pyridinyl]-methyl]sulfinyl]-1 H\u2013 benzimidazole sodium salt. It has an empirical formula of C 18 H 20 N 3 NaO 3 S and a molecular weight of 381.42. Rabeprazole sodium is a white to slightly yellowish-white solid. It is very soluble in water and methanol, freely soluble in ethanol, chloroform, and ethyl acetate and insoluble in ether and n-hexane. The stability of rabeprazole sodium is a function of pH; it is rapidly degraded in acid media, and is more stable under alkaline conditions. The structural figure is: Figure 1 ACIPHEX is available for oral administration as delayed-release, enteric-coated tablets containing 20 mg of rabeprazole sodium. Inactive ingredients of the 20 mg tablet are carnauba wax, crospovidone, diacetylated monoglycerides, ethylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hypromellose phthalate, magnesium stearate, mannitol, propylene glycol, sodium hydroxide, sodium stearyl fumarate, talc, and titanium dioxide. Iron oxide yellow is the coloring agent for the tablet coating. Iron oxide red is the ink pigment. ACIPHEX is available for oral administration as delayed-release, enteric-coated tablets containing 20 mg of rabeprazole sodium."

        "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 88/104-week carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice, rabeprazole at oral doses up to 100 mg/kg/day did not produce any increased tumor occurrence. The highest tested dose produced a systemic exposure to rabeprazole (AUC) of 1.40 \u00b5g\u2022hr/mL which is 1.6 times the human exposure (plasma AUC 0 - \u221e = 0.88 \u00b5g\u2022hr/mL) at the recommended dose for GERD (20 mg/day). In a 28-week carcinogenicity study in p53 +/- transgenic mice, rabeprazole at oral doses of 20, 60, and 200 mg/kg/day did not cause an increase in the incidence rates of tumors but produced gastric mucosal hyperplasia at all doses. The systemic exposure to rabeprazole at 200 mg/kg/day is about 17 to 24 times the human exposure at the recommended dose for GERD. In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in Sprague-Dawley rats, males were treated with oral doses of 5, 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day and females with 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 mg/kg/day. Rabeprazole produced gastric enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell hyperplasia in male and female rats and ECL cell carcinoid tumors in female rats at all doses including the lowest tested dose. The lowest dose (5 mg/kg/day) produced a systemic exposure to rabeprazole (AUC) of about 0.1 \u00b5g\u2022hr/mL which is about 0.1 times the human exposure at the recommended dose for GERD. In male rats, no treatment related tumors were observed at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day producing a rabeprazole plasma exposure (AUC) of about 0.2 \u00b5g\u2022hr/mL (0.2 times the human exposure at the recommended dose for GERD). Rabeprazole was positive in the Ames test, the Chinese hamster ovary cell (CHO/HGPRT) forward gene mutation test, and the mouse lymphoma cell (L5178Y/TK+/\u2013) forward gene mutation test. Its demethylated-metabolite was also positive in the Ames test. Rabeprazole was negative in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell chromosome aberration test, the in vivo mouse micronucleus test, and the in vivo and ex vivo rat hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) tests. Rabeprazole at intravenous doses up to 30 mg/kg/day (plasma AUC of 8.8 \u00b5g\u2022hr/mL, about 10 times the human exposure at the recommended dose for GERD) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats."

        "12.1 Mechanism of Action Rabeprazole belongs to a class of antisecretory compounds (substituted benzimidazole proton-pump inhibitors) that do not exhibit anticholinergic or histamine H 2 -receptor antagonist properties, but suppress gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the gastric H + , K + ATPase at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, rabeprazole has been characterized as a gastric proton-pump inhibitor. Rabeprazole blocks the final step of gastric acid secretion. In gastric parietal cells, rabeprazole is protonated, accumulates, and is transformed to an active sulfenamide. When studied in vitro , rabeprazole is chemically activated at pH 1.2 with a half-life of 78 seconds. It inhibits acid transport in porcine gastric vesicles with a half-life of 90 seconds."

      "pharmacokinetics": [
        "12.3 Pharmacokinetics After oral administration of 20 mg ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of rabeprazole occur over a range of 2 to 5 hours (T max ). The rabeprazole C max and AUC are linear over an oral dose range of 10 mg to 40 mg. There is no appreciable accumulation when doses of 10 mg to 40 mg are administered every 24 hours; the pharmacokinetics of rabeprazole is not altered by multiple dosing. Absorption Absolute bioavailability for a 20 mg oral tablet of rabeprazole (compared to intravenous administration) is approximately 52%. When ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets are administered with a high fat meal, T max is variable; which concomitant food intake may delay the absorption up to 4 hours or longer. However, the C max and the extent of rabeprazole absorption (AUC) are not significantly altered. Thus ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets may be taken without regard to timing of meals. Distribution Rabeprazole is 96.3% bound to human plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism: Rabeprazole is extensively metabolized. A significant portion of rabeprazole is metabolized via systemic nonenzymatic reduction to a thioether compound. Rabeprazole is also metabolized to sulphone and desmethyl compounds via cytochrome P450 in the liver. The thioether and sulphone are the primary metabolites measured in human plasma. These metabolites were not observed to have significant antisecretory activity. In vitro studies have demonstrated that rabeprazole is metabolized in the liver primarily by cytochromes P450 3A (CYP3A) to a sulphone metabolite and cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) to desmethyl rabeprazole. CYP2C19 exhibits a known genetic polymorphism due to its deficiency in some sub-populations (e.g., 3 to 5% of Caucasians and 17 to 20% of Asians). Rabeprazole metabolism is slow in these sub-populations, therefore, they are referred to as poor metabolizers of the drug. E xcretion : Following a single 20 mg oral dose of 14 C-labeled rabeprazole, approximately 90% of the drug was eliminated in the urine, primarily as thioether carboxylic acid; its glucuronide, and mercapturic acid metabolites. The remainder of the dose was recovered in the feces. Total recovery of radioactivity was 99.8%. No unchanged rabeprazole was recovered in the urine or feces. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population : In 20 healthy elderly subjects administered 20 mg ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets once daily for seven days, AUC values approximately doubled and the C max increased by 60% compared to values in a parallel younger control group. There was no evidence of drug accumulation after once daily administration [ see Use in Specific Population (8.5) ] . Age: Pediatric Population : The pharmacokinetics of rabeprazole was studied in 12 adolescent patients with GERD 12 to 16 years of age, in a multicenter study. Patients received 20 mg ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets once daily for five or seven days. An approximate 40% increase in rabeprazole exposure was noted following 5 to 7 days of dosing compared with the exposure after 1 day dosing. Pharmacokinetic parameters in adolescent patients with GERD 12 to 16 years of age were within the range observed in healthy adult subjects. Sex and Race /Ethnicity : In analyses adjusted for body mass and height, rabeprazole pharmacokinetics showed no clinically significant differences between male and female subjects. In studies that used different formulations of rabeprazole, AUC 0 - \u221e values for healthy Japanese men were approximately 50 to 60% greater than values derived from pooled data from healthy men in the United States. Renal Impairment : In 10 patients with stable end-stage renal disease requiring maintenance hemodialysis (creatinine clearance \u22645 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), no clinically significant differences were observed in the pharmacokinetics of rabeprazole after a single 20 mg dose of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets when compared to 10 healthy subjects. Hepatic Impairment : In a single dose study of 10 patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and B, respectively) who were administered a single 20 mg dose of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets, AUC 0-24 was approximately doubled, the elimination half-life was 2- to 3-fold higher, and total body clearance was decreased to less than half compared to values in healthy men. In a multiple dose study of 12 patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment administered 20 mg ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets once daily for eight days, AUC 0- \u221e and C max values increased approximately 20% compared to values in healthy age- and gender-matched subjects. These increases were not statistically significant. No information exists on rabeprazole disposition in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Drug Interaction Studies Combined Administration with Antimicrobials: Sixteen healthy subjects genotyped as extensive metabolizers with respect to CYP2C19 were given 20 mg ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets, 1000 mg amoxicillin, 500 mg clarithromycin, or all 3 drugs in a four-way crossover study. Each of the four regimens was administered twice daily for 6 days. The AUC and C max for clarithromycin and amoxicillin were not different following combined administration compared to values following single administration. However, the rabeprazole AUC and C max increased by 11% and 34%, respectively, following combined administration. The AUC and C max for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin (active metabolite of clarithromycin) also increased by 42% and 46%, respectively. This increase in exposure to rabeprazole and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not expected to produce safety concerns. Effects of Other Drugs on Rabeprazole Antacids : Co-administration of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets and antacids produced no clinically relevant changes in plasma rabeprazole concentrations. Effects of Rabeprazole on Other Drugs Studies in healthy subjects have shown that rabeprazole does not have clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the CYP450 system, such as theophylline (CYP1A2) given as single oral doses, diazepam (CYP2C9 and CYP3A4) as a single intravenous dose, and phenytoin (CYP2C9 and CYP2C19) given as a single intravenous dose (with supplemental oral dosing). Steady state interactions of rabeprazole and other drugs metabolized by this enzyme system have not been studied in patients. Clopidogrel: Clopidogrel is metabolized to its active metabolite in part by CYP2C19. A study of healthy subjects including CYP2C19 extensive and intermediate metabolizers receiving once daily administration of clopidogrel 75 mg concomitantly with placebo or with 20 mg ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets (n=36), for 7 days was conducted. The mean AUC of the active metabolite of clopidogrel was reduced by approximately 12% (mean AUC ratio was 88 %, with 90% CI of 81.7 to 95.5%) when ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets were coadministered compared to administration of clopidogrel with placebo [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Digoxin : In healthy adult subjects (n=16), co-administration of 20 mg rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets with 2.5 mg once daily doses of digoxin at steady state resulted in approximately 29% and 19% increase in mean C max and AUC (0-24) of digoxin [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Ketoconazole: In healthy adult subjects (n=19), co-administration of 20 mg rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets at steady state with a single 400 mg oral dose ketoconazole resulted in approximately an average of 31% reduction in both C max and AUC (0-inf) of ketoconazole [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Cyclosporine: In vitro incubations employing human liver microsomes indicated that rabeprazole inhibited cyclosporine metabolism with an IC 50 of 62 micromolar, a concentration that is over 50 times higher than the C max in healthy volunteers following 14 days of dosing with 20 mg of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets. This degree of inhibition is similar to that by omeprazole at equivalent concentrations."

        "8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets have been established in pediatric patients for adolescent patients 12 years of age and older for the treatment of symptomatic GERD. Use of ACIPEX delayed-release tablets in this age group is supported by adequate and well controlled studies in adults and a multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group study in 111 adolescent patients 12 to 16 years of age. Patients had a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic GERD, or suspected or endoscopically proven GERD and were randomized to either 10 mg or 20 mg once daily for up to 8 weeks for the evaluation of safety and efficacy. The adverse reaction profile in adolescent patients was similar to that of adults. The related reported adverse reactions that occurred in \u22652% of patients were headache (5%) and nausea (2%). There were no adverse reactions reported in these studies that were not previously observed in adults. The safety and effectiveness of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets have not been established in pediatric patients for: Healing of Erosive or Ulcerative GERD Maintenance of Healing of Erosive or Ulcerative GERD Treatment of Symptomatic GERD Healing of Duodenal Ulcers Helicobacter pylori Eradication to Reduce the Risk of Duodenal Ulcer Recurrence Treatment of Pathological Hypersecretory Conditions, Including Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome ACIPHEX delayed-release 20 mg tablets are not recommended for use in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age because the tablet strength exceeds the recommended dose for these patients [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. For pediatric patients 1 year to less than 12 years of age consider another rabeprazole formulation. The safety and effectiveness of a different dosage form and dosage strength of rabeprazole has been established in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years for the treatment of GERD. Juvenile Animal Data Studies in juvenile and young adult rats and dogs were performed. In juvenile animal studies rabeprazole sodium was administered orally to rats for up to 5 weeks and to dogs for up to 13 weeks, each commencing on Day 7 post-partum and followed by a 13-week recovery period. Rats were dosed at 5, 25, or 150 mg/kg/day and dogs were dosed at 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg/day. The data from these studies were comparable to those reported for young adult animals. Pharmacologically mediated changes, including increased serum gastrin levels and stomach changes, were observed at all dose levels in both rats and dogs. These observations were reversible over the 13-week recovery periods. Although body weights and/or crown-rump lengths were minimally decreased during dosing, no effects on the development parameters were noted in either juvenile rats or dogs. When juvenile animals were treated for 28 days with a different PPI at doses equal to or greater than 34 times the daily oral human dose on a body surface area basis, overall growth was affected and treatment-related decreases in body weight (approximately 14%) and body weight gain, and decreases in femur weight and femur length were observed."

        "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available human data on ACIPHEX use in pregnant women to inform the drug associated risk. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. However, the background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2 to 4% and of miscarriage is 15 to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies. No evidence of adverse developmental effects were seen in animal reproduction studies with rabeprazole administered during organogenesis at 13 and 8 times the human area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) at the recommended dose for GERD,in rats and rabbits, respectively [ see Data ] . Changes in bone morphology were observed in offspring of rats treated with oral doses of a different PPI through most of pregnancy and lactation [ see Data ] . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Data Animal Data Embryo-fetal developmental studies have been performed in rats during organogenesis at intravenous doses of rabeprazole up to 50 mg/kg/day (plasma AUC of 11.8 \u00b5g\u2022hr/mL, about 13 times the human exposure at the recommended oral dose for GERD) and rabbits at intravenous doses up to 30 mg/kg/day (plasma AUC of 7.3 \u00b5g\u2022hr/mL, about 8 times the human exposure at the recommended oral dose for GERD) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to rabeprazole. Administration of rabeprazole to rats in late gestation and during lactation at an oral dose of 400 mg/kg/day (about 195-times the human oral dose based on mg/m 2 ) resulted in decreases in body weight gain of the pups. A pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity study in rats with additional endpoints to evaluate bone development was performed with a different PPI at about 3.4 to 57 times an oral human dose on a body surface area basis. Decreased femur length, width and thickness of cortical bone, decreased thickness of the tibial growth plate, and minimal to mild bone marrow hypocellularity were noted at doses of this PPI equal to or greater than 3.4 times an oral human dose on a body surface area basis. Physeal dysplasia in the femur was also observed in offspring after in utero and lactational exposure to the PPI at doses equal to or greater than 33.6 times an oral human dose on a body surface area basis. Effects on maternal bone were observed in pregnant and lactating rats in a pre- and postnatal toxicity study when the PPI was administered at oral doses of 3.4 to 57 times an oral human dose on a body surface area basis. When rats were dosed from gestational day 7 through weaning on postnatal day 21, a statistically significant decrease in maternal femur weight of up to 14% (as compared to placebo treatment) was observed at doses equal to or greater than 33.6 times an oral human dose on a body surface area basis."

      "microbiology": [
        "12.4 Microbiology The following in vitro data are available but the clinical significance is unknown. Rabeprazole sodium, amoxicillin and clarithromycin as a three drug regimen has been shown to be active against most strains of Helicobacter pylori in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage (1) , Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . Helicobacter pylori Susceptibility testing of H. pylori isolates was performed for amoxicillin and clarithromycin using agar dilution methodology 1 , and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined. Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. Incidence of Antibiotic-Resistant Organisms Among Clinical Isolates Pretreatment Resistance: Clarithromycin pretreatment resistance rate (MIC \u22651 mcg/mL) to H. pylori was 9% (51/560) at baseline in all treatment groups combined. Greater than 99% (558/560) of patients had H. pylori isolates which were considered to be susceptible (MIC \u22640.25 mcg/mL) to amoxicillin at baseline. Two patients had baseline H. pylori isolates with an amoxicillin MIC of 0.5 mcg/mL. For susceptibility testing information about Helicobacter pylori, see Microbiology section in prescribing information for clarithromycin and amoxicillin. Table 6: Clarithromycin Susceptibility Test Results and Clinical/ Bacteriologic Outcomes a for a Three Drug Regimen (ACIPHEX Delayed-Release Tablets 20 mg Twice Daily, Amoxicillin 1000 mg Twice Daily, and Clarithromycin 500 mg Twice Daily for 7 or 10 Days) Days of RAC Therapy Clarithromycin Pretreatment Results Total Number H. pylori Negative (Eradicated) H. pylori Positive (Persistent) Post-Treatment Susceptibility Results S b I b R b No MIC 7 Susceptible b 129 103 2 0 1 23 7 Intermediate b 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 Resistant b 16 5 2 1 4 4 10 Susceptible b 133 111 3 1 2 16 10 Intermediate b 0 0 0 0 0 0 10 Resistant b 9 1 0 0 5 3 a Includes only patients with pretreatment and post-treatment clarithromycin susceptibility test results. b Susceptible (S) MIC \u22640.25 mcg/mL, Intermediate (I) MIC = 0.5 mcg/mL, Resistant (R) MIC \u22651 mcg/mL Patients with persistent H. pylori infection following rabeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin therapy will likely have clarithromycin resistant clinical isolates. Therefore, clarithromycin susceptibility testing should be done when possible. If resistance to clarithromycin is demonstrated or susceptibility testing is not possible, alternative antimicrobial therapy should be instituted. Amoxicillin Susceptibility Test Results and Clinical/Bacteriological Outcomes: In the U.S. multicenter study, greater than 99% (558/560) of patients had H. pylori isolates which were considered to be susceptible (MIC \u22640.25 mcg/mL) to amoxicillin at baseline. The other 2 patients had baseline H. pylori isolates with an amoxicillin MIC of 0.5 mcg/mL, and both isolates were clarithromycin-resistant at baseline; in one case the H. pylori was eradicated. In the 7- and 10-day treatment groups 75% (107/145) and 79% (112/142), respectively, of the patients who had pretreatment amoxicillin susceptible MICs (\u22640.25 mcg/mL) were eradicated of H. pylori . No patients developed amoxicillin-resistant H. pylori during therapy."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Gastric Malignancy : Symptomatic response to therapy with rabeprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy ( 5.1 ). Use with Warfarin : Monitor for increases in INR and prothombin time ( 5.2 , 7 ). Acute Interstitial Nephritis : Observed in patients taking PPIs ( 5.3 ). Cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) Deficiency : Daily long-term use (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption or a deficiency of cyanocobalamin ( 5.4 ). Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea : PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of ( 5.5 ). Bone Fracture : Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine ( 5.6 ). Hypomagnesemia : Reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs ( 5.7 ). Interaction with Methotrexate : Concomitant use with PPIs may elevate and/or prolong serum concentrations of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to toxicity. With high dose methotrexate administration, consider a temporary withdrawal of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets ( 5.8 , 7 ). 5.1 Presence of G astric M alignancy Symptomatic response to therapy with ACIPHEX does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Patients with healed GERD were treated for up to 40 months with ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets and monitored with serial gastric biopsies. Patients without H. pylori infection (221 of 326 patients) had no clinically important pathologic changes in the gastric mucosa. Patients with H. pylori infection at baseline (105 of 326 patients) had mild or moderate inflammation in the gastric body or mild inflammation in the gastric antrum. Patients with mild grades of infection or inflammation in the gastric body tended to change to moderate, whereas those graded moderate at baseline tended to remain stable. Patients with mild grades of infection or inflammation in the gastric antrum tended to remain stable. At baseline 8% of patients had atrophy of glands in the gastric body and 15% had atrophy in the gastric antrum. At endpoint, 15% of patients had atrophy of glands in the gastric body and 11% had atrophy in the gastric antrum. Approximately 4% of patients had intestinal metaplasia at some point during follow-up, but no consistent changes were seen. 5.2 Interaction with W arfarin Steady state interactions of rabeprazole and warfarin have not been adequately evaluated in patients. There have been reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving a proton pump inhibitor and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets and warfarin concomitantly may need to be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . 5.3 Acute Interstitial Nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs including ACIPHEX. Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue ACIPHEX if acute interstitial nephritis develops [ see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.4 Cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) Deficiency Daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed in patients treated with ACIPHEX. 5. 5 Clostridium difficile A ssociated D iarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like ACIPHEX may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents. For more information specific to antibacterial agents (clarithromycin and amoxicillin) indicated for use in combination with ACIPHEX, refer to Warnings and Precautions sections of the corresponding prescribing information. 5. 6 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies in adults suggest that PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [ see Dosage and Administration (2) , Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . 5. 7 Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), healthcare professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . 5. 8 Interaction with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information ) may elevate and prolong serum concentrations of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [ see Drug Interactions (7) ] ."

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Eisai Inc. at 1-888-274-2378 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adults The data described below reflect exposure to ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets in 1064 adult patients exposed for up to 8 weeks. The studies were primarily placebo- and active-controlled trials in adult patients with Erosive or Ulcerative Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD), Duodenal Ulcers and Gastric Ulcers. The population had a mean age of 53 years (range 18-89 years) and had a ratio of approximately 60% male: 40% female. The racial distribution was 86% Caucasian, 8% African American, 2% Asian, and 5% other. Most patients received either 10 mg, 20 mg or 40 mg per day of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets. An analysis of adverse reactions appearing in \u22652% of patients treated with ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets (n=1064) and with a greater frequency than placebo (n=89) in controlled North American and European acute treatment trials, revealed the following adverse reactions: pain (3% vs. 1%), pharyngitis (3% vs. 2%), flatulence (3% vs. 1%), infection (2% vs. 1%), and constipation (2% vs. 1%). Three long-term maintenance studies consisted of a total of 740 adult patients; at least 54% of adult patients were exposed to ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets for 6 months and at least 33% were exposed for 12 months. Of the 740 adult patients, 247 (33%) and 241 (33%) patients received 10 mg and 20 mg of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets, respectively, while 169 (23%) patients received placebo and 83 (11%) received omeprazole. The safety profile of rabeprazole in the maintenance studies in adults was consistent with what was observed in the acute studies. Less common adverse reactions seen in controlled clinical trials (<2% of patients treated with ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets and greater than placebo) and for which there is a possibility of a causal relationship to rabeprazole, include the following: headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, dizziness, peripheral edema, hepatic enzyme increase, hepatitis, hepatic encephalopathy, myalgia, and arthralgia. Combination Treatment with Amoxicillin and Clarithromycin: In clinical trials using combination therapy with rabeprazole plus amoxicillin and clarithromycin (RAC), no adverse reactions unique to this drug combination were observed. In the U.S. multicenter study, the most frequently reported drug related adverse reactions for patients who received RAC therapy for 7 or 10 days were diarrhea (8% and 7%) and taste perversion (6% and 10%), respectively. No clinically significant laboratory abnormalities particular to the drug combinations were observed. For more information on adverse reactions or laboratory changes with amoxicillin or clarithromycin, refer to their respective prescribing information, Adverse Reactions section. Pediatric s In a multicenter, open-label study of adolescent patients 12 to 16 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic GERD or endoscopically proven GERD, the adverse event profile was similar to that of adults. The adverse reactions reported without regard to relationship to ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets that occurred in \u22652% of 111 patients were headache (9.9%), diarrhea (4.5%), nausea (4.5%), vomiting (3.6%), and abdominal pain (3.6%). The related reported adverse reactions that occurred in \u22652% of patients were headache (5.4%) and nausea (1.8%). There were no adverse reactions reported in this study that were not previously observed in adults. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of rabeprazole. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: sudden death; coma, hyperammonemia; jaundice; rhabdomyolysis; disorientation and delirium; anaphylaxis; angioedema; bullous and other drug eruptions of the skin; severe dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (some fatal), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and erythema multiforme; interstitial pneumonia; interstitial nephritis; TSH elevations; bone fractures; hypomagnesemia and Clostridium diffic i le - associated diarrhea. In addition, agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, and thrombocytopenia have been reported. Increases in prothrombin time/INR in patients treated with concomitant warfarin have been reported."

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pediatric Use : Dosage strength not appropriate for patients less than 12 years ( 2 , 8.4 ). 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available human data on ACIPHEX use in pregnant women to inform the drug associated risk. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. However, the background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2 to 4% and of miscarriage is 15 to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies. No evidence of adverse developmental effects were seen in animal reproduction studies with rabeprazole administered during organogenesis at 13 and 8 times the human area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) at the recommended dose for GERD,in rats and rabbits, respectively [ see Data ] . Changes in bone morphology were observed in offspring of rats treated with oral doses of a different PPI through most of pregnancy and lactation [ see Data ] . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Data Animal Data Embryo-fetal developmental studies have been performed in rats during organogenesis at intravenous doses of rabeprazole up to 50 mg/kg/day (plasma AUC of 11.8 \u00b5g\u2022hr/mL, about 13 times the human exposure at the recommended oral dose for GERD) and rabbits at intravenous doses up to 30 mg/kg/day (plasma AUC of 7.3 \u00b5g\u2022hr/mL, about 8 times the human exposure at the recommended oral dose for GERD) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to rabeprazole. Administration of rabeprazole to rats in late gestation and during lactation at an oral dose of 400 mg/kg/day (about 195-times the human oral dose based on mg/m 2 ) resulted in decreases in body weight gain of the pups. A pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity study in rats with additional endpoints to evaluate bone development was performed with a different PPI at about 3.4 to 57 times an oral human dose on a body surface area basis. Decreased femur length, width and thickness of cortical bone, decreased thickness of the tibial growth plate, and minimal to mild bone marrow hypocellularity were noted at doses of this PPI equal to or greater than 3.4 times an oral human dose on a body surface area basis. Physeal dysplasia in the femur was also observed in offspring after in utero and lactational exposure to the PPI at doses equal to or greater than 33.6 times an oral human dose on a body surface area basis. Effects on maternal bone were observed in pregnant and lactating rats in a pre- and postnatal toxicity study when the PPI was administered at oral doses of 3.4 to 57 times an oral human dose on a body surface area basis. When rats were dosed from gestational day 7 through weaning on postnatal day 21, a statistically significant decrease in maternal femur weight of up to 14% (as compared to placebo treatment) was observed at doses equal to or greater than 33.6 times an oral human dose on a body surface area basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Lactation studies have not been conducted to assess the presence of rabeprazole in human milk, the effects of rabeprazole on the breastfed infant, or the effects of rabeprazole on milk production. Rabeprazole is present in rat milk. The development and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for ACIPHEX and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ACIPHEX or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets have been established in pediatric patients for adolescent patients 12 years of age and older for the treatment of symptomatic GERD. Use of ACIPEX delayed-release tablets in this age group is supported by adequate and well controlled studies in adults and a multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group study in 111 adolescent patients 12 to 16 years of age. Patients had a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic GERD, or suspected or endoscopically proven GERD and were randomized to either 10 mg or 20 mg once daily for up to 8 weeks for the evaluation of safety and efficacy. The adverse reaction profile in adolescent patients was similar to that of adults. The related reported adverse reactions that occurred in \u22652% of patients were headache (5%) and nausea (2%). There were no adverse reactions reported in these studies that were not previously observed in adults. The safety and effectiveness of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets have not been established in pediatric patients for: Healing of Erosive or Ulcerative GERD Maintenance of Healing of Erosive or Ulcerative GERD Treatment of Symptomatic GERD Healing of Duodenal Ulcers Helicobacter pylori Eradication to Reduce the Risk of Duodenal Ulcer Recurrence Treatment of Pathological Hypersecretory Conditions, Including Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome ACIPHEX delayed-release 20 mg tablets are not recommended for use in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age because the tablet strength exceeds the recommended dose for these patients [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. For pediatric patients 1 year to less than 12 years of age consider another rabeprazole formulation. The safety and effectiveness of a different dosage form and dosage strength of rabeprazole has been established in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years for the treatment of GERD. Juvenile Animal Data Studies in juvenile and young adult rats and dogs were performed. In juvenile animal studies rabeprazole sodium was administered orally to rats for up to 5 weeks and to dogs for up to 13 weeks, each commencing on Day 7 post-partum and followed by a 13-week recovery period. Rats were dosed at 5, 25, or 150 mg/kg/day and dogs were dosed at 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg/day. The data from these studies were comparable to those reported for young adult animals. Pharmacologically mediated changes, including increased serum gastrin levels and stomach changes, were observed at all dose levels in both rats and dogs. These observations were reversible over the 13-week recovery periods. Although body weights and/or crown-rump lengths were minimally decreased during dosing, no effects on the development parameters were noted in either juvenile rats or dogs. When juvenile animals were treated for 28 days with a different PPI at doses equal to or greater than 34 times the daily oral human dose on a body surface area basis, overall growth was affected and treatment-related decreases in body weight (approximately 14%) and body weight gain, and decreases in femur weight and femur length were observed. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects (n=2009) in clinical studies of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets, 19% were 65 years and over, while 4% were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. 8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment Administration of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets to patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and B, respectively) resulted in increased exposure and decreased elimination [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. There is no information in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). Avoid use of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets in patients with severe hepatic impairment; however, if treatment is necessary, monitor patients for adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5) , Adverse Reactions (6) ] ."

        "12.5 Pharmacogenomics In a clinical study in evaluating ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets in Japanese adult patients categorized by CYP2C19 genotype (n=6 per genotype category), gastric acid suppression was higher in poor metabolizers as compared to extensive metabolizers. This could be due to higher rabeprazole plasma levels in poor metabolizers. The clinical relevance of this is not known. Whether or not interactions of rabeprazole sodium with other drugs metabolized by CYP2C19 would be different between extensive metabolizers and poor metabolizers has not been studied."

For this and all studies of GERD healing, only patients with GERD symptoms and at least grade 2 esophagitis (modified Hetzel-Dent grading scale) were eligible for entry. Endoscopic healing was defined as grade 0 or 1. Each rabeprazole dose was significantly superior to placebo in producing endoscopic healing after four and eight weeks of treatment. The percentage of patients demonstrating endoscopic healing was as follows: Table 7: Healing of Erosive or Ulcerative Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (Gerd) Percentage of Patients Healed Week ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets Placebo N=25 10 mg once daily N=27 20 mg once daily N=25 40 mg once daily N=26 4 63%* 56%* 54%* 0% 8 93%* 84%* 85%* 12% * (p<0.001 versus placebo) In addition, there was a statistically significant difference in favor of the ACIPHEX 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg doses compared to placebo at Weeks 4 and 8 regarding complete resolution of GERD heartburn frequency (p\u22640.026). All ACIPHEX groups reported significantly greater rates of complete resolution of GERD daytime heartburn severity compared to placebo at Weeks 4 and 8 (p\u22640.036). Mean reductions from baseline in daily antacid dose were statistically significant for all ACIPHEX groups when compared to placebo at both Weeks 4 and 8 (p\u22640.007). In a North American multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study of 336 patients, the percentage of patients healed at endoscopy after four and eight weeks of treatment was statisticially superior in the patients treated with ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets compared to ranitidine: Table 8: Healing Of Erosive Or Ulcerative Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) Percentage of Patients Healed Week 20 mg ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets once daily N=167 Ranitidine 150 mg four times daily N=169 4 59%* 36% 8 87%* 66% * (p<0.001 versus ranitidine) A dose of 20 mg once daily of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets was significantly more effective than ranitidine 150 mg four times daily in the percentage of patients with complete resolution of heartburn at Weeks 4 and 8 (p<0.001). ACIPHEX was also more effective in complete resolution of daytime heartburn (p\u22640.025), and nighttime heartburn (p\u22640.012) at both Weeks 4 and 8, with significant differences by the end of the first week of the study. The recommended dosage of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets is 20 mg once daily for 4 to 8 weeks. 14.2 Long-term Maintenance of Healing of Erosive or Ulcerative GERD in Adults The long-term maintenance of healing in patients with erosive or ulcerative GERD previously healed with gastric antisecretory therapy was assessed in two U.S., multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of identical design of 52 weeks duration. The two studies randomized 209 and 285 patients, respectively, to receive either 10 mg or 20 mg of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets once daily or placebo. As demonstrated in Tables 10 and 11 below, patients treated with ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets were significantly superior to placebo in both studies with respect to the maintenance of healing of GERD and the proportions of patients remaining free of heartburn symptoms at 52 weeks. The recommended dosage of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets is 20 mg once daily.

Patients reported 5 or more periods of moderate to very severe heartburn during the placebo treatment phase the week prior to randomization. Patients were confirmed by endoscopy to have no esophageal erosions. The percentage of heartburn free daytime and/or nighttime periods was greater with 20 mg ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets compared to placebo over the 4 weeks of study in Study RAB-USA-2 (47% vs. 23%) and Study RAB-USA-3 (52% vs. 28%). The mean decreases from baseline in average daytime and nighttime heartburn scores were significantly greater for ACIPHEX 20 mg as compared to placebo at week 4. Graphical displays depicting the daily mean daytime and nighttime scores are provided in Figures 2 to 5. Figure 2: Mean Daytime Heartburn Scores RAB-USA-2 Figure 3: Mean Nighttime Heartburn Scores RAB-USA-2 Figure 4: Mean Daytime Heartburn Scores RAB-USA-3 Figure 5: Mean Nighttime Heartburn Scores RAB-USA-3 In addition, the combined analysis of these two studies showed 20 mg of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets significantly improved other GERD-associated symptoms (regurgitation, belching, and early satiety) by week 4 compared with placebo (all p values <0.005). A dose of 20 mg ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets also significantly reduced daily antacid consumption versus placebo over 4 weeks (p<0.001). The recommended dosage of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets is 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks. 14.4 Healing of Duodenal Ulcers in Adults In a U.S., randomized, double-blind, multicenter study assessing the effectiveness of 20 mg and 40 mg of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets once daily versus placebo for healing endoscopically defined duodenal ulcers, 100 patients were treated for up to four weeks. ACIPHEX was significantly superior to placebo in producing healing of duodenal ulcers. The percentages of patients with endoscopic healing are presented below: Table 11: Healing of Duodenal Ulcers Percentage of Patients Healed Week ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets Placebo N=33 20 mg once daily N=34 40 mg once daily N=33 2 44% 42% 21% 4 79%* 91%* 39% * p\u22640.001 versus placebo At Weeks 2 and 4, significantly more patients in the ACIPHEX 20 and 40 mg groups reported complete resolution of ulcer pain frequency (p\u22640.018), daytime pain severity (p\u22640.023), and nighttime pain severity (p\u22640.035) compared with placebo patients. The only exception was the 40 mg group versus placebo at Week 2 for duodenal ulcer pain frequency (p=0.094). Significant differences in resolution of daytime and nighttime pain were noted in both ACIPHEX groups relative to placebo by the end of the first week of the study. Significant reductions in daily antacid use were also noted in both ACIPHEX groups compared to placebo at Weeks 2 and 4 (p<0.001). An international randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial was conducted in 205 patients comparing 20 mg ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets once daily with 20 mg omeprazole once daily. The study was designed to provide at least 80% power to exclude a difference of at least 10% between ACIPHEX and omeprazole, assuming four-week healing response rates of 93% for both groups. In patients with endoscopically defined duodenal ulcers treated for up to four weeks, ACIPHEX was comparable to omeprazole in producing healing of duodenal ulcers. The percentages of patients with endoscopic healing at two and four weeks are presented below: Table 12: Healing of Duodenal Ulcers Percentage of Patients Healed Week ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets 20 mg once daily N=102 Omeprazole 20 mg once daily N=103 95% Confidence Interval for the Treatment Difference (ACIPHEX - Omeprazole) 2 69% 61% (\u20136%, 22%) 4 98% 93% (\u20133%, 15%) ACIPHEX and omeprazole were comparable in providing complete resolution of symptoms. The recommended dosage of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets is 20 mg once daily for 4 weeks. 14.5 Helicobacter pylori Eradication in Patien ts with Peptic Ulcer Disease or Symptomatic Non-Ulcer Disease in Adults The U.S. multicenter study was a double-blind, parallel-group comparison of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin for 3, 7, or 10 days vs. omeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin for 10 days. Therapy consisted of rabeprazole 20 mg twice daily, amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily, and clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily (RAC) or omeprazole 20 mg twice daily, amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily, and clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily (OAC). Patients with H. pylori infection were stratified in a 1:1 ratio for those with peptic ulcer disease (active or a history of ulcer in the past five years) [PUD] and those who were symptomatic but without peptic ulcer disease [NPUD], as determined by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The overall H. pylori eradication rates, defined as negative 13 C-UBT for H. pylori \u22656 weeks from the end of the treatment are shown in the following table. The eradication rates in the 7-day and 10-day RAC regimens were found to be similar to 10-day OAC regimen using either the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) or Per-Protocol (PP) populations. Eradication rates in the RAC 3-day regimen were inferior to the other regimens. Table 13: Helicobacter Pylori Eradication at \u22656 Weeks After the End of Treatment Treatment Group Percent (%) of Patients Cured (Number of Patients) Difference (RAC \u2013 OAC) [95% Confidence Interval] 7-day RAC* 10-day OAC Per Protocol a 84.3% (N=166) 81.6% (N=179) 2.8 [- 5.2, 10.7] Intent-to-Treat b 77.3% (N=194) 73.3% (N=206) 4.0 [- 4.4, 12.5] 10-day RAC* 10-day OAC Per Protocol a 86.0% (N=171) 81.6% (N=179) 4.4 [- 3.3, 12.1] Intent-to-Treat b 78.1% (N=196) 73.3% (N=206) 4.8 [- 3.6, 13.2] 3-day RAC 10-day OAC Per Protocol a 29.9% (N=167) 81.6% (N=179) - 51.6 [- 60.6, - 42.6] Intent-to-Treat b 27.3% (N=187) 73.3% (N=206) - 46.0 [- 54.8, - 37.2] a Patients were included in the analysis if they had H. pylori infection documented at baseline, defined as a positive 13 C-UBT plus rapid urease test or culture and were not protocol violators. Patients who dropped out of the study due to an adverse event related to the study drug were included in the evaluable analysis as failures of therapy. b Patients were included in the analysis if they had documented H. pylori infection at baseline as defined above and took at least one dose of study medication. All dropouts were included as failures of therapy. * The 95% confidence intervals for the difference in eradication rates for 7-day RAC minus 10-day RAC are (- 9.3, 6.0) in the PP population and (-9.0, 7.5) in the ITT population. The recommended dosage of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets is 20 mg twice daily with amoxicillin and clarithromycin for 7 days. 14.6 Pathological Hypersecretory Conditions, Including Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome in Adults Twelve patients with idiopathic gastric hypersecretion or Zollinger-Ellison syndrome have been treated successfully with ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets at doses from 20 to 120 mg for up to 12 months. ACIPHEX produced satisfactory inhibition of gastric acid secretion in all patients and complete resolution of signs and symptoms of acid-peptic disease where present. ACIPHEX also prevented recurrence of gastric hypersecretion and manifestations of acid-peptic disease in all patients. The high doses of ACIPHEX used to treat this small cohort of patients with gastric hypersecretion were well tolerated. The recommended starting dosage of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets is 60 mg once daily."

        "MEDICATION GUIDE ACIPHEX \u00ae (a-se-feks) (rabeprazole sodium) delayed-release tablets Read the Medication Guide that comes with ACIPHEX before you start taking it and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This Medication Guide does not take the place of talking to your doctor about your medical condition or treatment. What is the most important information I should know about ACIPHEX? ACIPHEX may help your acid-related symptoms, but you could still have serious stomach problems. Talk with your doctor. ACIPHEX can cause serious side effects, including: Diarrhea . ACIPHEX may increase your risk of getting severe diarrhea. This diarrhea may be caused by an infection ( Clostridium difficile ) in your intestines. Call your doctor right away if you have watery stool, stomach pain, and fever that does not go away. Bone fractures. People who take multiple daily doses of Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) medicines for a long period of time (1 year or longer) may have an increased risk of fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. You should take ACIPHEX exactly as prescribed, at the lowest dose possible for your treatment and for the shortest time needed. Talk to your doctor about your risk of bone fracture if you take ACIPHEX. ACIPHEX can have other serious side effects. See \u201cWhat are the possible side effects of ACIPHEX?\u201d What is ACIPHEX? ACIPHEX is a prescription medicine called a Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI). ACIPHEX reduces the amount of acid in your stomach. ACIPHEX is used in adults: for up to 8 weeks to heal acid-related damage to the lining of the esophagus (called erosive esophagitis or EE) and to relieve symptoms, such as heartburn pain. If needed, your doctor may decide to prescribe another 8 weeks of ACIPHEX. to maintain the healing of the esophagus and relief of symptoms related to EE. It is not known if ACIPHEX is safe and effective if used longer than 12 months (1 year). for up to 4 weeks to treat daytime and nighttime heartburn and other symptoms that happen with Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD). GERD happens when acid in your stomach backs up into the tube (esophagus) that connects your mouth to your stomach. This may cause a burning feeling in your chest or throat, sour taste, or burping. for up to 4 weeks for the healing and relief of duodenal ulcers. The duodenal area is the area where food passes when it leaves the stomach. for 7 days with certain antibiotic medicines to treat an infection caused by bacteria called H. pylori . Sometimes H. pylori bacteria can cause duodenal ulcers. The infection needs to be treated to prevent the ulcers from coming back. for the long-term treatment of conditions where your stomach makes too much acid.

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Rabeprazole belongs to a class of antisecretory compounds (substituted benzimidazole proton-pump inhibitors) that do not exhibit anticholinergic or histamine H 2 -receptor antagonist properties, but suppress gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the gastric H + , K + ATPase at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, rabeprazole has been characterized as a gastric proton-pump inhibitor. Rabeprazole blocks the final step of gastric acid secretion. In gastric parietal cells, rabeprazole is protonated, accumulates, and is transformed to an active sulfenamide. When studied in vitro , rabeprazole is chemically activated at pH 1.2 with a half-life of 78 seconds. It inhibits acid transport in porcine gastric vesicles with a half-life of 90 seconds. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Antisecretory Activity The antisecretory effect begins within one hour after oral administration of 20 mg ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets. The median inhibitory effect of rabeprazole on 24 hour gastric acidity is 88% of maximal after the first dose. A 20 mg dose of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets inhibits basal and peptone meal-stimulated acid secretion versus placebo by 86% and 95%, respectively, and increases the percent of a 24-hour period that the gastric pH>3 from 10% to 65% ( see table below ). This relatively prolonged pharmacodynamic action compared to the short pharmacokinetic half-life (1 to 2 hours) reflects the sustained inactivation of the H + , K + ATPase. Table 3: Gastric Acid Parameters: ACIPHEX Delayed-Release Tablets versus Placebo After 7 Days of Once Daily Dosing Parameter ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets (20 mg once daily) Placebo Basal Acid Output (mmol/hr) 0.4* 2.8 Stimulated Acid Output (mmol/hr) 0.6* 13.3 % Time Gastric pH>3 65* 10 *(p<0.01 versus placebo) Compared to placebo, 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets, administered once daily for 7 days significantly decreased intragastric acidity with all doses for each of four meal-related intervals and the 24-hour time period overall. In this study, there were no statistically significant differences between doses; however, there was a significant dose-related decrease in intragastric acidity. The ability of rabeprazole to cause a dose-related decrease in mean intragastric acidity is illustrated below. Table 4: AUC Acidity (Mmol\u2022Hr/L): ACIPHEX Delayed-Release Tablets versus Placebo on Day 7 of Once Daily Dosing (Mean\u00b1SD) ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets Placebo (N=24) AUC interval (hrs) 10 mg (N=24) 20 mg (N=24) 40 mg (N=24) 08:00 \u2013 13:00 19.6\u00b121.5* 12.9\u00b123* 7.6\u00b114.7* 91.1\u00b139.7 13:00 \u2013 19:00 5.6\u00b19.7* 8.3\u00b129.8* 1.3\u00b15.2* 95.5\u00b148.7 19:00 \u2013 22:00 0.1\u00b10.1* 0.1\u00b10.06* 0.0\u00b10.02* 11.9\u00b112.5 22:00 \u2013 08:00 129.2\u00b184* 109.6\u00b167.2* 76.9\u00b158.4* 479.9\u00b1165 AUC 0-24 hours 155.5\u00b190.6* 130.9\u00b181* 85.8\u00b164.3* 678.5\u00b1216 *(p<0.001 versus placebo) After administration of 20 mg ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets once daily for eight days, the mean percent of time that gastric pH greater than 3 or gastric pH greater than 4 after a single dose (Day 1) and multiple doses (Day 8) was significantly greater than placebo ( see table below ). The decrease in gastric acidity and the increase in gastric pH observed with 20 mg ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets administered once daily for eight days were compared to the same parameters for placebo, as illustrated below: Table 5: Gastric Acid Parameters ACIPHEX Delayed-Release Tablets Once Daily Dosing versus Placebo on Day 1 and Day 8 Parameter ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets 20 mg once daily Placebo Day 1 Day 8 Day 1 Day 8 Mean AUC 0-24 Acidity 340.8* 176.9* 925.5 862.4 Median trough pH (23-hr) a 3.77 3.51 1.27 1.38 % Time Gastric pH greater than 3 b 54.6* 68.7* 19.1 21.7 % Time Gastric pH greater than 4 b 44.1* 60.3* 7.6 11.0 a No inferential statistics conducted for this parameter. b Gastric pH was measured every hour over a 24-hour period. * (p<0.001 versus placebo) Effects on Esophageal Acid Exposure In patients with GERD and moderate to severe esophageal acid exposure, a dose of 20 mg and 40 mg per day of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets decreased 24-hour esophageal acid exposure. After seven days of treatment, the percentage of time that the esophageal pH was less than 4 decreased from baselines of 24.7% for 20 mg and 23.7% for 40 mg, to 5.1% and 2.0%, respectively. Normalization of 24-hour intraesophageal acid exposure was correlated to gastric pH greater than 4 for at least 35% of the 24-hour period; this level was achieved in 90% of subjects receiving ACIPHEX 20 mg and in 100% of subjects receiving ACIPHEX 40 mg. With ACIPHEX 20 mg and 40 mg per day, significant effects on gastric and esophageal pH were noted after one day of treatment, and more pronounced after seven days of treatment. Effects on Serum Gastrin The median fasting gastrin level increased in a dose-related manner in patients treated once daily with ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets for up to eight weeks for ulcerative or erosive esophagitis and in patients treated for up to 52 weeks to prevent recurrence of disease. The group median values stayed within the normal range. In a group of subjects treated with 20 mg ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets for 4 weeks a doubling of mean serum gastrin concentrations was observed. Approximately 35% of these treated subjects developed serum gastrin concentrations above the upper limit of normal. Effects on Enterochromaffin-like (ECL) Cells Increased serum gastrin secondary to antisecretory agents stimulates proliferation of gastric ECL cells which, over time, may result in ECL cell hyperplasia in rats and mice and gastric carcinoids in rats, especially in females [ see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . In over 400 patients treated with ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets (10 or 20 mg) once daily for up to one year, the incidence of ECL cell hyperplasia increased with time and dose, which is consistent with the pharmacological action of the proton-pump inhibitor. No patient developed the adenomatoid, dysplastic or neoplastic changes of ECL cells in the gastric mucosa. No patient developed the carcinoid tumors observed in rats. Endocrine Effects Studies in humans for up to one year have not revealed clinically significant effects on the endocrine system. In healthy male subjects treated with ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets for 13 days, no clinically relevant changes have been detected in the following endocrine parameters examined: 17 \u03b2-estradiol, thyroid stimulating hormone, tri-iodothyronine, thyroxine, thyroxine-binding protein, parathyroid hormone, insulin, glucagon, renin, aldosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteotrophic hormone, prolactin, somatotrophic hormone, dehydroepiandrosterone, cortisol-binding globulin, and urinary 6\u03b2-hydroxycortisol, serum testosterone and circadian cortisol profile. Other Effects In humans treated with ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets for up to one year, no systemic effects have been observed on the central nervous, lymphoid, hematopoietic, renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, or respiratory systems. No data are available on long-term treatment with ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets and ocular effects. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After oral administration of 20 mg ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets, peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of rabeprazole occur over a range of 2 to 5 hours (T max ). The rabeprazole C max and AUC are linear over an oral dose range of 10 mg to 40 mg. There is no appreciable accumulation when doses of 10 mg to 40 mg are administered every 24 hours; the pharmacokinetics of rabeprazole is not altered by multiple dosing. Absorption Absolute bioavailability for a 20 mg oral tablet of rabeprazole (compared to intravenous administration) is approximately 52%. When ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets are administered with a high fat meal, T max is variable; which concomitant food intake may delay the absorption up to 4 hours or longer. However, the C max and the extent of rabeprazole absorption (AUC) are not significantly altered. Thus ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets may be taken without regard to timing of meals. Distribution Rabeprazole is 96.3% bound to human plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism: Rabeprazole is extensively metabolized. A significant portion of rabeprazole is metabolized via systemic nonenzymatic reduction to a thioether compound. Rabeprazole is also metabolized to sulphone and desmethyl compounds via cytochrome P450 in the liver. The thioether and sulphone are the primary metabolites measured in human plasma. These metabolites were not observed to have significant antisecretory activity. In vitro studies have demonstrated that rabeprazole is metabolized in the liver primarily by cytochromes P450 3A (CYP3A) to a sulphone metabolite and cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) to desmethyl rabeprazole. CYP2C19 exhibits a known genetic polymorphism due to its deficiency in some sub-populations (e.g., 3 to 5% of Caucasians and 17 to 20% of Asians). Rabeprazole metabolism is slow in these sub-populations, therefore, they are referred to as poor metabolizers of the drug. E xcretion : Following a single 20 mg oral dose of 14 C-labeled rabeprazole, approximately 90% of the drug was eliminated in the urine, primarily as thioether carboxylic acid; its glucuronide, and mercapturic acid metabolites. The remainder of the dose was recovered in the feces. Total recovery of radioactivity was 99.8%. No unchanged rabeprazole was recovered in the urine or feces. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population : In 20 healthy elderly subjects administered 20 mg ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets once daily for seven days, AUC values approximately doubled and the C max increased by 60% compared to values in a parallel younger control group. There was no evidence of drug accumulation after once daily administration [ see Use in Specific Population (8.5) ] . Age: Pediatric Population : The pharmacokinetics of rabeprazole was studied in 12 adolescent patients with GERD 12 to 16 years of age, in a multicenter study. Patients received 20 mg ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets once daily for five or seven days. An approximate 40% increase in rabeprazole exposure was noted following 5 to 7 days of dosing compared with the exposure after 1 day dosing. Pharmacokinetic parameters in adolescent patients with GERD 12 to 16 years of age were within the range observed in healthy adult subjects. Sex and Race /Ethnicity : In analyses adjusted for body mass and height, rabeprazole pharmacokinetics showed no clinically significant differences between male and female subjects. In studies that used different formulations of rabeprazole, AUC 0 - \u221e values for healthy Japanese men were approximately 50 to 60% greater than values derived from pooled data from healthy men in the United States. Renal Impairment : In 10 patients with stable end-stage renal disease requiring maintenance hemodialysis (creatinine clearance \u22645 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), no clinically significant differences were observed in the pharmacokinetics of rabeprazole after a single 20 mg dose of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets when compared to 10 healthy subjects. Hepatic Impairment : In a single dose study of 10 patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and B, respectively) who were administered a single 20 mg dose of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets, AUC 0-24 was approximately doubled, the elimination half-life was 2- to 3-fold higher, and total body clearance was decreased to less than half compared to values in healthy men. In a multiple dose study of 12 patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment administered 20 mg ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets once daily for eight days, AUC 0- \u221e and C max values increased approximately 20% compared to values in healthy age- and gender-matched subjects. These increases were not statistically significant. No information exists on rabeprazole disposition in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Drug Interaction Studies Combined Administration with Antimicrobials: Sixteen healthy subjects genotyped as extensive metabolizers with respect to CYP2C19 were given 20 mg ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets, 1000 mg amoxicillin, 500 mg clarithromycin, or all 3 drugs in a four-way crossover study. Each of the four regimens was administered twice daily for 6 days. The AUC and C max for clarithromycin and amoxicillin were not different following combined administration compared to values following single administration. However, the rabeprazole AUC and C max increased by 11% and 34%, respectively, following combined administration. The AUC and C max for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin (active metabolite of clarithromycin) also increased by 42% and 46%, respectively. This increase in exposure to rabeprazole and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not expected to produce safety concerns. Effects of Other Drugs on Rabeprazole Antacids : Co-administration of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets and antacids produced no clinically relevant changes in plasma rabeprazole concentrations. Effects of Rabeprazole on Other Drugs Studies in healthy subjects have shown that rabeprazole does not have clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the CYP450 system, such as theophylline (CYP1A2) given as single oral doses, diazepam (CYP2C9 and CYP3A4) as a single intravenous dose, and phenytoin (CYP2C9 and CYP2C19) given as a single intravenous dose (with supplemental oral dosing). Steady state interactions of rabeprazole and other drugs metabolized by this enzyme system have not been studied in patients. Clopidogrel: Clopidogrel is metabolized to its active metabolite in part by CYP2C19. A study of healthy subjects including CYP2C19 extensive and intermediate metabolizers receiving once daily administration of clopidogrel 75 mg concomitantly with placebo or with 20 mg ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets (n=36), for 7 days was conducted. The mean AUC of the active metabolite of clopidogrel was reduced by approximately 12% (mean AUC ratio was 88 %, with 90% CI of 81.7 to 95.5%) when ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets were coadministered compared to administration of clopidogrel with placebo [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Digoxin : In healthy adult subjects (n=16), co-administration of 20 mg rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets with 2.5 mg once daily doses of digoxin at steady state resulted in approximately 29% and 19% increase in mean C max and AUC (0-24) of digoxin [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Ketoconazole: In healthy adult subjects (n=19), co-administration of 20 mg rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets at steady state with a single 400 mg oral dose ketoconazole resulted in approximately an average of 31% reduction in both C max and AUC (0-inf) of ketoconazole [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Cyclosporine: In vitro incubations employing human liver microsomes indicated that rabeprazole inhibited cyclosporine metabolism with an IC 50 of 62 micromolar, a concentration that is over 50 times higher than the C max in healthy volunteers following 14 days of dosing with 20 mg of ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets. This degree of inhibition is similar to that by omeprazole at equivalent concentrations. 12.4 Microbiology The following in vitro data are available but the clinical significance is unknown. Rabeprazole sodium, amoxicillin and clarithromycin as a three drug regimen has been shown to be active against most strains of Helicobacter pylori in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage (1) , Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . Helicobacter pylori Susceptibility testing of H. pylori isolates was performed for amoxicillin and clarithromycin using agar dilution methodology 1 , and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined. Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. Incidence of Antibiotic-Resistant Organisms Among Clinical Isolates Pretreatment Resistance: Clarithromycin pretreatment resistance rate (MIC \u22651 mcg/mL) to H. pylori was 9% (51/560) at baseline in all treatment groups combined. Greater than 99% (558/560) of patients had H. pylori isolates which were considered to be susceptible (MIC \u22640.25 mcg/mL) to amoxicillin at baseline. Two patients had baseline H. pylori isolates with an amoxicillin MIC of 0.5 mcg/mL. For susceptibility testing information about Helicobacter pylori, see Microbiology section in prescribing information for clarithromycin and amoxicillin. Table 6: Clarithromycin Susceptibility Test Results and Clinical/ Bacteriologic Outcomes a for a Three Drug Regimen (ACIPHEX Delayed-Release Tablets 20 mg Twice Daily, Amoxicillin 1000 mg Twice Daily, and Clarithromycin 500 mg Twice Daily for 7 or 10 Days) Days of RAC Therapy Clarithromycin Pretreatment Results Total Number H. pylori Negative (Eradicated) H. pylori Positive (Persistent) Post-Treatment Susceptibility Results S b I b R b No MIC 7 Susceptible b 129 103 2 0 1 23 7 Intermediate b 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 Resistant b 16 5 2 1 4 4 10 Susceptible b 133 111 3 1 2 16 10 Intermediate b 0 0 0 0 0 0 10 Resistant b 9 1 0 0 5 3 a Includes only patients with pretreatment and post-treatment clarithromycin susceptibility test results. b Susceptible (S) MIC \u22640.25 mcg/mL, Intermediate (I) MIC = 0.5 mcg/mL, Resistant (R) MIC \u22651 mcg/mL Patients with persistent H. pylori infection following rabeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin therapy will likely have clarithromycin resistant clinical isolates. Therefore, clarithromycin susceptibility testing should be done when possible. If resistance to clarithromycin is demonstrated or susceptibility testing is not possible, alternative antimicrobial therapy should be instituted. Amoxicillin Susceptibility Test Results and Clinical/Bacteriological Outcomes: In the U.S. multicenter study, greater than 99% (558/560) of patients had H. pylori isolates which were considered to be susceptible (MIC \u22640.25 mcg/mL) to amoxicillin at baseline. The other 2 patients had baseline H. pylori isolates with an amoxicillin MIC of 0.5 mcg/mL, and both isolates were clarithromycin-resistant at baseline; in one case the H. pylori was eradicated. In the 7- and 10-day treatment groups 75% (107/145) and 79% (112/142), respectively, of the patients who had pretreatment amoxicillin susceptible MICs (\u22640.25 mcg/mL) were eradicated of H. pylori . No patients developed amoxicillin-resistant H. pylori during therapy. 12.5 Pharmacogenomics In a clinical study in evaluating ACIPHEX delayed-release tablets in Japanese adult patients categorized by CYP2C19 genotype (n=6 per genotype category), gastric acid suppression was higher in poor metabolizers as compared to extensive metabolizers. This could be due to higher rabeprazole plasma levels in poor metabolizers. The clinical relevance of this is not known. Whether or not interactions of rabeprazole sodium with other drugs metabolized by CYP2C19 would be different between extensive metabolizers and poor metabolizers has not been studied."

      "precautions": [
        "PRECAUTIONS General 1. Effects Seen with Sympathomimetic Drugs: \u200b \u200bAs with all products containing sympathomimetic amines, Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension; in patients with convulsive disorders, hyperthyroidism, or diabetes mellitus; and in patients who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. Large doses of intravenous albuterol have been reported to aggravate pre-existing diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis. Additionally, \u03b2-agonists may cause a decrease in serum potassium in some patients, possibly through intracellular shunting. The decrease is usually transient, not requiring supplementation. 2. Effects Seen with Anticholinergic Drugs: Due to the presence of ipratropium bromide in Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution, it should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, or bladder-neck obstruction. 3. Use in Hepatic or Renal Diseases : Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency. It should be used with caution in these patient populations. Information for Patients: The action of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution should last up to 5 hours. Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution should not be used more frequently than recommended. Patients should be instructed not to increase the dose or frequency of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution without consulting their healthcare provider. If symptoms worsen, patients should be instructed to seek medical consultation. Patients must avoid exposing their eyes to this product as temporary pupillary dilation, blurred vision, eye pain, or precipitation or worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma may occur, and therefore proper nebulizer technique should be assured, particularly if a mask is used. If a patient becomes pregnant or begins nursing while on Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution, they should contact their healthcare provider about use of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution. See the illustrated Patient\u2019s Instruction for Use in the product package insert. Drug Interactions Anticholinergic agents: Although ipratropium bromide is minimally absorbed into the systemic circulation, there is some potential for an additive interaction with concomitantly used anticholinergic medications. Caution is, therefore, advised in the co-administration of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution with other drugs having anticholinergic properties. \u03b2-adrenergic agents: Caution is advised in the co-administration of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution and other sympathomimetic agents due to the increased risk of adverse cardiovascular effects. \u03b2-receptor blocking agents: These agents and albuterol sulfate inhibit the effect of each other. \u03b2-receptor blocking agents should be used with caution in patients with hyperreactive airways, and if used, relatively selective \u03b2 \u200b1 selective agents are recommended. Diuretics: The electrocardiogram (ECG) changes and/or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of non-potassium sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by \u03b2-agonists, especially when the recommended dose of the \u03b2-agonist is exceeded. Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the co-administration of \u03b2-agonist containing drugs, such as Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution, with non-potassium sparing diuretics. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants: Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, or within 2 weeks of discontinuation of such agents because the action of albuterol sulfate on the cardiovascular system may be potentiated. Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility: Albuterol Sulfate: In a 2-year study in Sprague-Dawley rats, albuterol sulfate caused a significant dose-related increase in the incidence of benign leiomyomas of the mesovarium at and above dietary doses of 2 mg/kg (approximately equal to the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m \u200b2 basis). In another study, this effect was blocked by the co-administration of propranolol, a non- selective beta-adrenergic antagonist. In an 18-month study in CD-1 mice, albuterol sulfate showed no evidence of tumorigenicity at dietary doses up to 500 mg/kg (approximately 140 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m \u200b2 basis). In a 22-month study in Golden hamsters, albuterol sulfate showed no evidence of tumorigenicity at dietary doses up to 50 mg/kg (approximately 20 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m \u200b2 basis). Albuterol sulfate was not mutagenic in the Ames test or a mutation test in yeast. Albuterol sulfate was not clastogenic in a human peripheral lymphocyte assay or in an AH1 strain mouse micronucleus assay. Reproduction studies in rats demonstrated no evidence of impaired fertility at oral doses of albuterol sulfate up to 50 mg/kg (approximately 25 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m \u200b2 basis). Ipratropium bromide: In 2-year studies in Sprague-Dawley rats and CD-1 mice, ipratropium bromide showed no evidence of tumorigenicity at oral doses up to 6 mg/kg (approximately 15 times and 8 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults in rats and mice, respectively, on a mg/m \u200b2 basis). Ipratropium bromide was not mutagenic in the Ames test and mouse dominant lethal test. Ipratropium bromide was not clastogenic in a mouse micronucleus assay. A reproduction study in rats demonstrated decreased conception and increased resorptions when ipratropium bromide was administered orally at a dose of 90 mg/kg (approximately 240 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m \u200b2 basis). These effects were not seen with a dose of 50 mg/kg (approximately 140 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m \u200b2 basis). Pregnancy TERATOGENIC EFFECTS: Pregnancy Category C Albuterol sulfate: Pregnancy Category C. \u200b Albuterol sulfate has been shown to be teratogenic in mice. A study in CD-1 mice given albuterol sulfate subcutaneously showed cleft palate formation in 5 of 111 (4.5%) fetuses at 0.25 mg/kg (less than the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m \u200b2 basis) and in 10 of 108 (9.3%) fetuses at 2.5 mg/kg (approximately equal to the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m \u200b2 basis). The drug did not induce cleft palate formation when administered subcutaneously at a dose of 0.025 mg/kg (less than the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m \u200b2 basis). Cleft palate formation also occurred in 22 of 72 (30.5%) fetuses from females treated subcutaneously with 2.5 mg/kg isoproterenol (positive control). A reproduction study in Stride rabbits revealed cranioschisis in 7 of 19 (37%) fetuses when albuterol was administered orally at a dose of 50 mg/kg (approximately 55 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on mg/m \u200b2 basis). A study in which pregnant rats were dosed with radiolabeled albuterol sulfate demonstrated that drug-related material is transferred from the maternal circulation to the fetus. During worldwide marketing experience, various congenital anomalies, including cleft palate and limb defects, have been reported in the offspring of patients being treated with albuterol. Some of the mothers were taking multiple medications during their pregnancies. Because no consistent pattern of defects can be discerned, a relationship between albuterol use and congenital anomalies has not been established. Ipratropium bromide: Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies in CD-1 mice, Sprague-Dawley rats and New Zealand rabbits demonstrated no evidence of teratogenicity at oral doses up to 10, 100, and 125 mg/kg, respectively (approximately 15, 270, and 680 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m \u200b2 basis). Reproduction studies in rats and rabbits demonstrated no evidence of teratogenicity at inhalation doses up to 1.5 and 1.8 mg/kg, respectively (approximately 4 and 10 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m \u200b2 basis). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of the use of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution, albuterol sulfate, or ipratropium bromide in pregnant women. Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Labor and Delivery: Oral albuterol sulfate has been shown to delay preterm labor in some reports. Because of the potential of albuterol to interfere with uterine contractility, use of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution during labor should be restricted to those patients in whom the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether the components of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution are excreted in human milk. Although lipid-insoluble quaternary bases pass into breast milk, it is unlikely that ipratropium bromide would reach the infant to an important extent, especially when taken as a nebulized solution. Because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for albuterol sulfate in some animals, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use: \u200bThe safety and effectiveness of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution in patients below 18 years of age have not been established. Geriatric Use: Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution, 62 percent were 65 and over, while 19 percent were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

        "DESCRIPTION The active components in Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution are albuterol sulfate and ipratropium bromide. Albuterol sulfate is a salt of racemic albuterol and a relatively selective \u03b2 \u200b2 -adrenergic bronchodilator chemically described as \u03b1 1 -[(tert-Butylamino) methyl]-4-hydroxy- m -xylene- \u03b1,\u03b1\u2032-diol sulfate (2:1) (salt). It has a molecular weight of 576.7 and the empirical formula is (C 13 H 21 NO 3 ) 2 \u2022 H 2 SO 4 . It is a white crystalline powder, soluble in water and slightly soluble in ethanol. The World Health Organization\u2019s recommended name for albuterol base is salbutamol. Ipratropium bromide is an anticholinergic bronchodilator chemically described as 8-azoniabicyclo[3.2.1]-octane,3-(3-hydroxy-1-oxo-2-phenylpropoxy)-8-methyl-8-(1-methylethyl)-,bromide, monohydrate (endo,syn)-, (\u00b1)-; a synthetic quaternary ammonium compound, chemically related to atropine. It has a molecular weight of 430.4 and the empirical formula is C \u200b20 H \u200b30 BrNO \u200b3 \u2022 H \u200b2 O. It is a white crystalline substance, freely soluble in water and lower alcohols, and insoluble in lipophilic solvents such as ether, chloroform, and fluorocarbons. Each 3 mL vial of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution contains 3 mg (0.1%) of albuterol sulfate (equivalent to 2.5 mg (0.083%) of albuterol base) and 0.5 mg (0.017%) of ipratropium bromide in an isotonic, sterile, aqueous solution containing sodium chloride and hydrochloric acid to adjust to pH 4. Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution is a clear, colorless solution. It does not require dilution prior to administration by nebulization. For Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution, like all other nebulized treatments, the amount delivered to the lungs will depend on patient factors, the jet nebulizer utilized, and compressor performance. Using the Pari-LC-Plus\u2122 nebulizer (with face mask or mouthpiece) connected to a PRONEB\u2122 compressor system, under in vitro conditions, the mean delivered dose from the mouth piece (% nominal dose) was approximately 46% of albuterol and 42% of ipratropium bromide at a mean flow rate of 3.6 L/min. The mean nebulization time was 15 minutes or less. Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution should be administered from jet nebulizers at adequate flow rates, via face masks or mouthpieces (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). image description"

      ],
      "mechanism_of_action": [
        "Albuterol sulfate: Mechanism of Action: \u200b The prime action of \u03b2-adrenergic drugs is to stimulate adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of cyclic-3\u2019,5\u2019-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) from adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The cAMP thus formed mediates the cellular responses. In vitro studies and in vivo pharmacologic studies have demonstrated that albuterol has a preferential effect on \u03b2 \u200b2 -adrenergic receptors compared with isoproterenol. While it is recognized that \u03b2 \u200b2 -adrenergic receptors are the predominant receptors in bronchial smooth muscle, recent data indicated that 10% to 50% of the \u03b2-receptors in the human heart may be \u03b2 \u200b2 -receptors. The precise function of these receptors, however, is not yet established. Albuterol has been shown in most controlled clinical trials to have more effect on the respiratory tract, in the form of bronchial smooth muscle relaxation, than isoproterenol at comparable doses while producing fewer cardiovascular effects. Controlled clinical studies and other clinical experience have shown that inhaled albuterol, like other \u03b2-adrenergic agonist drugs, can produce a significant cardiovascular effect in some patients.",
        "Ipratropium bromide: Mechanism of Action: \u200bIpratropium bromide is an anticholinergic (parasympatholytic) agent, which blocks the muscarinic receptors of acetylcholine, and, based on animal studies, appears to inhibit vagally mediated reflexes by antagonizing the action of acetylcholine, the transmitter agent released from the vagus nerve. Anticholinergics prevent the increases in intracellular concentration of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), resulting from the interaction of acetylcholine with the muscarinic receptors of bronchial smooth muscle.",
        "Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution: Mechanism of Action: Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution is expected to maximize the response to treatment in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) by reducing bronchospasm through two distinctly different mechanisms: sympathomimetic (albuterol sulfate) and anticholinergic / parasympatholytic (ipratropium bromide). Simultaneous administration of both an anticholinergic and a \u03b2 \u200b2 -sympathomimetic is designed to produce greater bronchodilation effects than when either drug is utilized alone at its recommended dosage."
      ],
      "pharmacokinetics": [
        "Pharmacokinetics : Albuterol sulfate is longer acting than isoproterenol in most patients by any route of administration, because it is not a substrate for the cellular uptake processes for catecholamines nor for the metabolism of catechol-O-methyl transferase. Instead the drug is conjugatively metabolized to albuterol 4\u2019-O-sulfate.",
        "Pharmacokinetics: The bronchodilation following inhalation of ipratropium is primarily a local, site-specific effect, not a systemic one. Much of an inhaled dose is swallowed as shown by fecal excretion studies. Following nebulization of a 1 mg dose to healthy volunteers, a mean of 4% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine. Ipratropium bromide is minimally (0% to 9% in vitro ) bound to plasma albumin and \u03b1 \u200b1 \u2013acid glycoproteins. It is partially metabolized to inactive ester hydrolysis products. Following intravenous administration, approximately one-half is excreted unchanged in the urine. The half-life of elimination is about 1.6 hours after intravenous administration. Ipratropium bromide that reaches the systemic circulation is reportedly removed by the kidneys rapidly at a rate that exceeds the glomerular filtration rate. The pharmacokinetics of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution or ipratropium bromide have not been studied in the elderly and in patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency (see PRECAUTIONS).",
        "\u200bPharmacokinetics: In a double-blind, double period, crossover study, 15 male and female subjects were administered single doses of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution or albuterol sulfate inhalation solution at two times the recommended single doses as two inhalations separated by 15 minutes. The total nebulized dose of albuterol sulfate from both treatments was 6 mg and the total dose of ipratropium bromide from Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution was 1 mg. Peak albuterol plasma concentrations occurred at 0.8 hours after dosing for both treatments. The mean peak albuterol concentration following administration of albuterol sulfate alone was 4.86 (\u00b12.65) ng/mL and it was 4.65 (\u00b1 2.92) ng/mL for Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution. Mean AUC values for the two treatments were 26.6 (\u00b1 15.2) ng\u2022hr/mL (albuterol sulfate alone) versus 24.2 (\u00b1 14.5) ng\u2022hr/mL (Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution). The mean t \u200b1/2 values were 7.2 (\u00b1 1.3) hours (albuterol sulfate alone) and 6.7 (\u00b1 1.7) hours (Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution). A mean of 8.4 (\u00b1 8.9)% of the albuterol dose was excreted unchanged in urine following administration of two vials of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution which is similar to 8.8 (\u00b1 7.3)% that was obtained from albuterol sulfate inhalation solution. There were no statistically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of albuterol between the two treatments. For ipratropium, a mean of 3.9 (\u00b1 5.1)% of the ipratropium bromide dose was excreted unchanged in the urine following two vials of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution, which is comparable with previously reported data."

      "warnings": [
        "WARNINGS Paradoxical Bronchospasm : In the clinical study of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution, paradoxical bronchospasm was not observed. However, paradoxical bronchospasm has been observed with both inhaled ipratropium bromide and albuterol products and can be life-threatening. If this occurs, Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted. Do Not Exceed Recommended Dose : Fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled products containing sympathomimetic amines and with the home use of nebulizers. Cardiovascular Effect: Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution, like other beta-adrenergic agonists, can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, and/or symptoms. Although such effects are uncommon for Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution at recommended doses, if they occur, the drug may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce ECG changes, such as flattening of the T-wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Therefore, Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution, like other sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension. Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions: Immediate hypersensitivity reactions to albuterol and/or ipratropium bromide may occur after the administration of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution as demonstrated by rare cases of urticaria, angioedema, rash, pruritus, oropharyngeal edema, bronchospasm, and anaphylaxis."

        "Pregnancy TERATOGENIC EFFECTS: Pregnancy Category C Albuterol sulfate: Pregnancy Category C. \u200b Albuterol sulfate has been shown to be teratogenic in mice. A study in CD-1 mice given albuterol sulfate subcutaneously showed cleft palate formation in 5 of 111 (4.5%) fetuses at 0.25 mg/kg (less than the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m \u200b2 basis) and in 10 of 108 (9.3%) fetuses at 2.5 mg/kg (approximately equal to the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m \u200b2 basis). The drug did not induce cleft palate formation when administered subcutaneously at a dose of 0.025 mg/kg (less than the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m \u200b2 basis). Cleft palate formation also occurred in 22 of 72 (30.5%) fetuses from females treated subcutaneously with 2.5 mg/kg isoproterenol (positive control). A reproduction study in Stride rabbits revealed cranioschisis in 7 of 19 (37%) fetuses when albuterol was administered orally at a dose of 50 mg/kg (approximately 55 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on mg/m \u200b2 basis). A study in which pregnant rats were dosed with radiolabeled albuterol sulfate demonstrated that drug-related material is transferred from the maternal circulation to the fetus. During worldwide marketing experience, various congenital anomalies, including cleft palate and limb defects, have been reported in the offspring of patients being treated with albuterol. Some of the mothers were taking multiple medications during their pregnancies. Because no consistent pattern of defects can be discerned, a relationship between albuterol use and congenital anomalies has not been established. Ipratropium bromide: Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies in CD-1 mice, Sprague-Dawley rats and New Zealand rabbits demonstrated no evidence of teratogenicity at oral doses up to 10, 100, and 125 mg/kg, respectively (approximately 15, 270, and 680 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m \u200b2 basis). Reproduction studies in rats and rabbits demonstrated no evidence of teratogenicity at inhalation doses up to 1.5 and 1.8 mg/kg, respectively (approximately 4 and 10 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m \u200b2 basis). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of the use of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution, albuterol sulfate, or ipratropium bromide in pregnant women. Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus."

Safety and efficacy of additional doses or increased frequency of administration of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution beyond these guidelines has not been studied and the safety and efficacy of extra doses of albuterol sulfate or ipratropium bromide in addition to the recommended doses of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution have not been studied. The use of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution can be continued as medically indicated to control recurring bouts of bronchospasm. If a previously effective regimen fails to provide the usual relief, medical advice should be sought immediately, as this is often a sign of worsening COPD, which would require reassessment of therapy. A Pari-LC-Plus\u2122 nebulizer (with face mask or mouthpiece) connected to a PRONEB\u2122 compressor was used to deliver Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution to each patient in one U.S. clinical study.

        "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution is a combination of the \u03b2 \u200b2 -adrenergic bronchodilator, albuterol sulfate, and the anticholinergic bronchodilator, ipratropium bromide. Albuterol sulfate: Mechanism of Action: \u200b The prime action of \u03b2-adrenergic drugs is to stimulate adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of cyclic-3\u2019,5\u2019-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) from adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The cAMP thus formed mediates the cellular responses. In vitro studies and in vivo pharmacologic studies have demonstrated that albuterol has a preferential effect on \u03b2 \u200b2 -adrenergic receptors compared with isoproterenol. While it is recognized that \u03b2 \u200b2 -adrenergic receptors are the predominant receptors in bronchial smooth muscle, recent data indicated that 10% to 50% of the \u03b2-receptors in the human heart may be \u03b2 \u200b2 -receptors. The precise function of these receptors, however, is not yet established. Albuterol has been shown in most controlled clinical trials to have more effect on the respiratory tract, in the form of bronchial smooth muscle relaxation, than isoproterenol at comparable doses while producing fewer cardiovascular effects. Controlled clinical studies and other clinical experience have shown that inhaled albuterol, like other \u03b2-adrenergic agonist drugs, can produce a significant cardiovascular effect in some patients. Pharmacokinetics : Albuterol sulfate is longer acting than isoproterenol in most patients by any route of administration, because it is not a substrate for the cellular uptake processes for catecholamines nor for the metabolism of catechol-O-methyl transferase. Instead the drug is conjugatively metabolized to albuterol 4\u2019-O-sulfate. Animal Pharmacology/Toxicology: Intravenous studies in rats with albuterol sulfate have demonstrated that albuterol crosses the blood-brain barrier and reaches brain concentrations amounting to approximately 5% of plasma concentrations. In structures outside of the blood-brain barrier (pineal and pituitary glands), albuterol concentrations were found to be 100 times those found in whole brain. Studies in laboratory animals (minipigs, rodents, and dogs) have demonstrated the occurrence of cardiac arrythmias and sudden death (with histological evidence of myocardial necrosis) when beta-agonists and methylxanthines are administered concurrently. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Ipratropium bromide: Mechanism of Action: \u200bIpratropium bromide is an anticholinergic (parasympatholytic) agent, which blocks the muscarinic receptors of acetylcholine, and, based on animal studies, appears to inhibit vagally mediated reflexes by antagonizing the action of acetylcholine, the transmitter agent released from the vagus nerve. Anticholinergics prevent the increases in intracellular concentration of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), resulting from the interaction of acetylcholine with the muscarinic receptors of bronchial smooth muscle. Pharmacokinetics: The bronchodilation following inhalation of ipratropium is primarily a local, site-specific effect, not a systemic one. Much of an inhaled dose is swallowed as shown by fecal excretion studies. Following nebulization of a 1 mg dose to healthy volunteers, a mean of 4% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine. Ipratropium bromide is minimally (0% to 9% in vitro ) bound to plasma albumin and \u03b1 \u200b1 \u2013acid glycoproteins. It is partially metabolized to inactive ester hydrolysis products. Following intravenous administration, approximately one-half is excreted unchanged in the urine. The half-life of elimination is about 1.6 hours after intravenous administration. Ipratropium bromide that reaches the systemic circulation is reportedly removed by the kidneys rapidly at a rate that exceeds the glomerular filtration rate. The pharmacokinetics of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution or ipratropium bromide have not been studied in the elderly and in patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency (see PRECAUTIONS). Animal Pharmacology/Toxicology: Autoradiographic studies in rats have shown that ipratropium does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution: Mechanism of Action: Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution is expected to maximize the response to treatment in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) by reducing bronchospasm through two distinctly different mechanisms: sympathomimetic (albuterol sulfate) and anticholinergic / parasympatholytic (ipratropium bromide). Simultaneous administration of both an anticholinergic and a \u03b2 \u200b2 -sympathomimetic is designed to produce greater bronchodilation effects than when either drug is utilized alone at its recommended dosage. Animal Pharmacology/Toxicology : In 30-day studies in Sprague-Dawley rats and Beagle dogs, subcutaneous doses of up to 205.5 mcg/kg of ipratropium administered with up to 1000 mcg/kg albuterol in rats and 3.16 mcg/kg ipratropium and 15 mcg/kg albuterol in dogs (less than the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m \u200b2 basis) did not cause death or potentiation of the cardiotoxicity induced by albuterol administered alone. \u200bPharmacokinetics: In a double-blind, double period, crossover study, 15 male and female subjects were administered single doses of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution or albuterol sulfate inhalation solution at two times the recommended single doses as two inhalations separated by 15 minutes. The total nebulized dose of albuterol sulfate from both treatments was 6 mg and the total dose of ipratropium bromide from Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution was 1 mg. Peak albuterol plasma concentrations occurred at 0.8 hours after dosing for both treatments. The mean peak albuterol concentration following administration of albuterol sulfate alone was 4.86 (\u00b12.65) ng/mL and it was 4.65 (\u00b1 2.92) ng/mL for Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution. Mean AUC values for the two treatments were 26.6 (\u00b1 15.2) ng\u2022hr/mL (albuterol sulfate alone) versus 24.2 (\u00b1 14.5) ng\u2022hr/mL (Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution). The mean t \u200b1/2 values were 7.2 (\u00b1 1.3) hours (albuterol sulfate alone) and 6.7 (\u00b1 1.7) hours (Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution). A mean of 8.4 (\u00b1 8.9)% of the albuterol dose was excreted unchanged in urine following administration of two vials of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution which is similar to 8.8 (\u00b1 7.3)% that was obtained from albuterol sulfate inhalation solution. There were no statistically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of albuterol between the two treatments. For ipratropium, a mean of 3.9 (\u00b1 5.1)% of the ipratropium bromide dose was excreted unchanged in the urine following two vials of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution, which is comparable with previously reported data."

In another study, this effect was blocked by the co-administration of propranolol, a non- selective beta-adrenergic antagonist. In an 18-month study in CD-1 mice, albuterol sulfate showed no evidence of tumorigenicity at dietary doses up to 500 mg/kg (approximately 140 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m \u200b2 basis). In a 22-month study in Golden hamsters, albuterol sulfate showed no evidence of tumorigenicity at dietary doses up to 50 mg/kg (approximately 20 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m \u200b2 basis). Albuterol sulfate was not mutagenic in the Ames test or a mutation test in yeast. Albuterol sulfate was not clastogenic in a human peripheral lymphocyte assay or in an AH1 strain mouse micronucleus assay. Reproduction studies in rats demonstrated no evidence of impaired fertility at oral doses of albuterol sulfate up to 50 mg/kg (approximately 25 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m \u200b2 basis).

Ipratropium bromide was not mutagenic in the Ames test and mouse dominant lethal test. Ipratropium bromide was not clastogenic in a mouse micronucleus assay. A reproduction study in rats demonstrated decreased conception and increased resorptions when ipratropium bromide was administered orally at a dose of 90 mg/kg (approximately 240 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m \u200b2 basis).

        "OVERDOSAGE \u200b The effects of overdosage with Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution are expected to be related primarily to albuterol sulfate, since ipratropium bromide is not well absorbed systemically after oral or aerosol administration. The expected symptoms with overdosage are those of excessive beta-adrenergic stimulation and/or occurrence or exaggeration of symptoms such as seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia with rates up to 200 beats per minute, arrhythmia, nervousness, headache, tremor, dry mouth, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, insomnia, and exaggeration of pharmacological effects listed in ADVERSE REACTIONS. Hypokalemia may also occur. As with all sympathomimetic aerosol medications, cardiac arrest and even death may be associated with abuse of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution. Treatment consists of discontinuation of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution together with appropriate symptomatic therapy. The judicious use of a cardioselective beta-receptor blocker may be considered, bearing in mind that such medication can produce bronchospasm. There is insufficient evidence to determine if dialysis is beneficial for overdosage of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution. The oral median lethal dose of albuterol sulfate in mice is greater than 2000 mg/kg (approximately 540 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution on a mg/m \u200b2 basis). The subcutaneous median lethal dose of albuterol sulfate in mature rats and small young rats is approximately 450 and 2000 mg/kg, respectively (approximately 240 and 1100 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution on a mg/m \u200b2 basis, respectively). The inhalation median lethal dose has not been determined in animals. The oral median lethal dose of ipratropium bromide in mice, rats and dogs is greater than 1000 mg/kg, approximately 1700 mg/kg and approximately 400 mg/kg, respectively (approximately 1400, 4600, and 3600 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults on a mg/m \u200b2 basis, respectively)."

      "clinical_pharmacology": [
        "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Corticosteroids are thought to act at least in part, by controlling the rate of synthesis of proteins. Although there are a number of instances in which the synthesis of specific proteins is known to be induced by corticosteroids, the links between the initial actions of the hormones and the final metabolic effects have not been completely elucidated. The physiologic action of fludrocortisone acetate is similar to that of hydrocortisone. However, the effects of fludrocortisone acetate, particularly on electrolyte balance, but also on carbohydrate metabolism, are considerably heightened and prolonged. Mineralocorticoids act on the distal tubules of the kidney to enhance the reabsorption of sodium ions from the tubular fluid into the plasma; they increase the urinary excretion of both potassium and hydrogen ions. The consequence of these three primary effects together with similar actions on cation transport in other tissues appear to account for the entire spectrum of physiological activities that are characteristic of mineralocorticoids. In small oral doses, fludrocortisone acetate produces marked sodium retention and increased urinary potassium excretion. It also causes a rise in blood pressure, apparently because of these effects on electrolyte levels. In larger doses, fludrocortisone acetate inhibits endogenous adrenal cortical secretion, thymic activity, and pituitary corticotropin excretion; promotes the deposition of liver glycogen; and, unless protein intake is adequate, induces negative nitrogen balance. The approximate plasma half-life of fludrocortisone (fluorohydrocortisone) is 3.5 hours or more and the biological half-life is 18 to 36 hours."

      "warnings": [
        "WARNINGS BECAUSE OF ITS MARKED EFFECT ON SODIUM RETENTION THE USE OF FLUDROCORTISONE ACETATE IN THE TREATMENT OF CONDITIONS OTHER THAN THOSE INDICATED HEREIN IS NOT ADVISED. Corticosteroids may mask some signs of infection, and new infections may appear during their use. There may be decreased resistance and inability to localize infection when corticosteroids are used. If an infection occurs during fludrocortisone acetate therapy, it should be promptly controlled by suitable antimicrobial therapy. Prolonged use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to fungi or viruses. Average and large doses of hydrocortisone or cortisone can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses. However, since fludrocortisone acetate is a potent mineralocorticoid, both the dosage and salt intake should be carefully monitored in order to avoid the development of hypertension, edema or weight gain. Periodic checking of serum electrolyte levels is advisable during prolonged therapy; dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion. Patients should not be vaccinated against smallpox while on corticosteroid therapy. Other immunization procedures should not be undertaken in patients who are on corticosteroids, especially on high dose, because of possible hazards of neurological complications and a lack of antibody response. The use of fludrocortisone acetate in patients with active tuberculosis should be restricted to those cases of fulminating or disseminated tuberculosis in which the corticosteroid is used for the management of the disease in conjunction with an appropriate antituberculous regimen. If corticosteroids are indicated in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, close observation is necessary since reactivation of the disease may occur. During prolonged corticosteroid therapy these patients should receive chemoprophylaxis. Children who are on immunosuppressant drugs are more susceptible to infections than healthy children. Chicken pox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in children on immunosuppressant corticosteroids. In such children, or in adults who have not had these diseases, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. If exposed, therapy with variicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or pooled intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), as appropriate, may be indicated. If chicken pox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered."

      "precautions": [
        "PRECAUTIONS General Adverse reactions to corticosteroids may be produced by too rapid withdrawal or by continued use of large doses. To avoid drug-induced adrenal insufficiency, supportive dosage may be required in times of stress (such as trauma, surgery, or severe illness) both during treatment with fludrocortisone acetate and for a year afterwards. There is an enhanced corticosteroid effect in patients with hypothyroidism and in those with cirrhosis. Corticosteroids should be used cautiously in patients with ocular herpes simplex because of possible corneal perforation. The lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition being treated. A gradual reduction in dosage should be made when possible. Psychic derangements may appear when corticosteroids are used. These may range from euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, and severe depression to frank psychotic manifestations. Existing emotional instability or psychotic tendencies may also be aggravated by corticosteroids. Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in patients with hypoprothrombinemia. Corticosteroids should be used with caution in patients with nonspecific ulcerative colitis if there is a probability of impending perforation, abscess, or other pyogenic infection. Corticosteroids should also be used cautiously in patients with diverticulitis, fresh intestinal anastomoses, active or latent peptic ulcer, renal insufficiency, hypertension, osteoporosis, and myasthenia gravis. Information for Patients The physician should advise the patient to report any medical history of heart disease, high blood pressure, or kidney or liver disease and to report current use of any medicines to determine if these medicines might interact adversely with fludrocortisone acetate (see Drug Interactions ). Patients who are on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids should be warned to avoid exposure to chicken pox or measles and, if exposed, to obtain medical advice. The patient's understanding of his steroid-dependent status and increased dosage requirement under widely variable conditions of stress is vital. Advise the patient to carry medical identification indicating his dependence on steroid medication and, if necessary, instruct him to carry an adequate supply of medication for use in emergencies. Stress to the patient the importance of regular follow-up visits to check his progress and the need to promptly notify the physician of dizziness, severe or continuing headaches, swelling of feet or lower legs, or unusual weight gain. Advise the patient to use the medicine only as directed, to take a missed dose as soon as possible, unless it is almost time for the next dose, and not to double the next dose. Inform the patient to keep this medication and all drugs out of the reach of children. Laboratory Tests Patients should be monitored regularly for blood pressure determinations and serum electrolyte determinations (see WARNINGS ). Drug Interactions When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with adrenal corticosteroids. Amphotericin B or potassium-depleting diuretics (benzothiadiazines and related drugs, ethacrynic acid and furosemide) \u2013 enhanced hypokalemia. Check serum potassium levels at frequent intervals; use potassium supplements if necessary (see WARNINGS ). Digitalis glycosides \u2013 enhanced possibility of arrhythmias or digitalis toxicity associated with hypokalemia. Monitor serum potassium levels; use potassium supplements if necessary. Oral anticoagulants \u2013 decreased prothrombin time response. Monitor prothrombin levels and adjust anticoagulant dosage accordingly. Antidiabetic drugs (oral agents and insulin) \u2013 diminished antidiabetic effect. Monitor for symptoms of hyperglycemia; adjust dosage of antidiabetic drug upward if necessary. Aspirin \u2013 increased ulcerogenic effect; decreased pharmacologic effect of aspirin. Rarely salicylate toxicity may occur in patients who discontinue steroids after concurrent high-dose aspirin therapy. Monitor salicylate levels or the therapeutic effect for which aspirin is given; adjust salicylate dosage accordingly if effect is altered (see PRECAUTIONS, General ). Barbiturates, phenytoin, or rifampin \u2013 increased metabolic clearance of fludrocortisone acetate because of the induction of hepatic enzymes. Observe the patient for possible diminished effect of steroid and increase the steroid dosage accordingly. Anabolic steroids (particularly C-17 alkylated androgens such as oxymetholone, methandrostenolone, norethandrolone, and similar compounds) \u2013 enhanced tendency toward edema. Use caution when giving these drugs together, especially in patients with hepatic or cardiac disease. Vaccines \u2013 neurological complications and lack of antibody response (see WARNINGS ). Estrogen \u2013 increased levels of corticosteroid-binding globulin thereby increasing the bound (inactive) fraction; this effect is at least balanced by decreased metabolism of corticosteroids. When estrogen therapy is initiated, a reduction in corticosteroid dosage may be required, and increased amounts may be required when estrogen is terminated. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Corticosteroids may affect the nitrobluetetrazolium test for bacterial infection and produce false-negative results. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Adequate studies have not been performed in animals to determine whether fludrocortisone acetate has carcinogenic or mutagenic activity or whether it affects fertility in males or females. Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: Category C Adequate animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with fludrocortisone acetate. However, many corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals at low doses. Teratogenicity of these agents in man has not been demonstrated. It is not known whether fludrocortisone acetate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Fludrocortisone acetate should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Pregnancy: Nonteratogenic Effects Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of fludrocortisone acetate during pregnancy should be carefully observed for signs of hypoadrenalism. Maternal treatment with corticosteroids should be carefully documented in the infant's medical records to assist in follow up. Nursing Mothers Corticosteroids are found in the breast milk of lactating women receiving systemic therapy with these agents. Caution should be exercised when fludrocortisone acetate is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established. Growth and development of infants and children on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should be carefully observed."

When fludrocortisone is used in the small dosages recommended, the glucocorticoid side effects often seen with cortisone and its derivatives are not usually a problem; however the following untoward effects should be kept in mind, particularly when fludrocortisone is used over a prolonged period of time or in conjunction with cortisone or a similar glucocorticoid. Musculoskeletal \u2013 muscle weakness, steroid myopathy, loss of muscle mass, osteoporosis, vertebral compression fractures, aseptic necrosis of femoral and humeral heads, pathologic fracture of long bones, and spontaneous fractures. Gastrointestinal \u2013 peptic ulcer with possible perforation and hemorrhage, pancreatitis, abdominal distention, and ulcerative esophagitis. Dermatologic \u2013 impaired wound healing, thin fragile skin, bruising, petechiae and ecchymoses, facial erythema, increased sweating, subcutaneous fat atrophy, purpura, striae, hyperpigmentation of the skin and nails, hirsutism, acneiform eruptions and hives; reactions to skin tests may be suppressed. Neurological \u2013 convulsions, increased intracranial pressure with papilledema (psuedo-tumor cerebri) usually after treatment, vertigo, headache, and severe mental disturbances. Endocrine \u2013 menstrual irregularities; development of the cushingoid state; suppression of growth in children; secondary adrenocortical and pituitary unresponsiveness, particularly in times of stress (e.g., trauma, surgery, or illness); decreased carbohydrate tolerance; manifestations of latent diabetes mellitus; and increased requirements for insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents in diabetics. Ophthalmic \u2013 posterior subcapsular cataracts, increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and exophthalmos. Metabolic \u2013 hyperglycemia, glycosuria, and negative nitrogen balance due to protein catabolism. Allergic Reactions \u2013 allergic skin rash, maculopapular rash, and urticaria. Other adverse reactions that may occur following the administration of a corticosteroid are necrotizing angiitis, thrombophlebitis, aggravation or masking of infections, insomnia, syncopal episodes, and anaphylactoid reactions.

Addison's Disease In Addison's disease, the combination of fludrocortisone acetate tablets with a glucocorticoid such as hydrocortisone or cortisone provides substitution therapy approximating normal adrenal activity with minimal risks of unwanted effects. The usual dose is 0.1 mg of fludrocortisone acetate tablets daily, although dosage ranging from 0.1 mg three times a week to 0.2 mg daily has been employed. In the event transient hypertension develops as a consequence of therapy, the dose should be reduced to 0.05 mg daily. Fludrocortisone acetate tablets are preferably administered in conjunction with cortisone (10 mg to 37.5 mg daily in divided doses) or hydrocortisone (10 mg to 30 mg daily in divided doses).
